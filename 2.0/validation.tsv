1	他无论飞到哪里都听见麻雀叽叽喳喳在叫，互相交谈说：“好一位稀客呀！ ”他听了心下好不喜欢。 	2
2	他们只好到大路上玩耍，可是路上灰尘太多，而且到处都是粗糙的石头，他们一点也不喜欢在路上玩。	1
3	The man went over to a little wood, and whistled.	0
4	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
5	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
6	Its feet were red with the blood of a newly–slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with seven beryls.	0
7	“你是我见过的最粗鲁的人，”火箭说，“你不理解我对王子的友谊。”	2
8	到我的城市上空去飞一趟，小燕子，回来告诉我你在下面看见了什么。” 	0
9	这可是世间最红的玫瑰。	0
10	后来，潜水者最后一次从水中上来,他带上来的那颗珍珠比所有的霍尔木兹回的珍珠还漂亮，它像满月那样有模有样,比晨星还耀眼。	0
11	我会在月光下用音乐孕育一朵；用我自己的心血把它染红。 	4
12	他跳上马鞍转过身来,十分难过地看着捕鱼的小伙子。 	1
13	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说，他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
14	谢谢你，小燕子，王子说。	4
15	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
16	但是那麻风病人苦苦哀求，星孩于是对他起了善心，把黄金送给他了。	4
17	I felt a great curiosity come over me.	0
18	“谁竟敢伤害你？”巨人大声责问道，“快告诉我，看我拿上我的大剑，去把他砍了。”	2
19	他真心为他过去的行为感到后悔。	1
20	What I sing of, he suffers, what is joy to me, to him is pain.	1
21	“这个有趣的小矮人生气了，”她叫道，“你一定要叫他起来，让他给我跳舞。 	2
22	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
23	“为了一朵红玫瑰，要豁上性命，这代价太大了，”夜莺尖声叫道，生命对谁来说都非常宝贵。	1
24	一股喷泉像细长的水晶挂在昏暗的空中。 	1
25	And the young Fisherman said to himself: 'How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.' And he passed out of the market–place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.	1
26	“可怜的小汉斯对这一要求什么话也不敢多说，第二天一大早磨坊主把自己的羊群赶到小农舍前，汉斯接上羊群到山上放去了。 	1
27	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
28	有谁关心过咱们？	1
29	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
30	But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more.	1
31	“不死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
32	The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.	0
33	他高兴得大叫起来，跑了过去，跪下来亲吻他母亲脚上的伤口，眼泪都把伤口打湿了。	0
34	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
35	And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.	4
36	Nay, but be merciful,' said his Soul: 'give me thy heart, for the world is very cruel, and I am afraid.'	3
37	But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made on his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.	3
38	别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀，兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	4
39	我称你这种行为是自私，而自私是顶顶讨厌的玩意儿，尤其我这种脾气受不了，因我生来就富有同情心，谁都知道的。	2
40	他们把柴火堆成了堆，火箭放在了最上面，然后点上了火。 	0
41	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
42	她从自己的腰带里抽出一把绿蛭蛇皮柄小刀，递给他。 	3
43	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	1
44	Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.’	3
45	“大家都去参加小汉斯的葬礼，因为他深受大家喜爱，磨坊主当上了丧主。 	1
46	实际上是你应该多想想我。	4
47	“你完全是一个惹人生气的家伙，”火箭说，没有一点儿教养。	2
48	在一块用小珍珠绣着狮子和卡斯提尔塔楼的大金色华盖下，安放着御座，上面盖了一块遍布银郁金香、巧饰着银子和珍珠坠子的黑天鹅绒布罩。 	0
49	The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of peach–blossom marble.	0
50	And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, ‘Take all the treasure and go from my city.	3
51	两只苍鹭在船周围飞来飞去。	3
52	接着冰雹停止了在头顶砰砰乱跳，北风不再呼呼吼叫,一股扑鼻的香气从开着的窗扉飘到了他跟前。	0
53	I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world.	0
54	寒风从森林刮过来，朝敞开的门吹去,冻得她浑身发抖，她哆哆嗦嗦对他说，你还不快把门关上？	3
55	小矮人笑，妖怪也跟着他笑；他把两只手卡在腰间，它也把手卡在腰间。 	0
56	And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.	0
57	小侍从见了吃了一惊，瞪起他那蓝蓝的大眼睛，微笑着跟他说：“陛下，我看你有皇袍和权杖，可你的皇冠在哪里呢？ 	3
58	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	4
59	但是，花儿们对他们的举止烦透了,对鸟儿们的举止也烦透了。 	2
60	“那天夜里，我正躺在石榴街那个茶馆里的垫子上，皇帝的禁卫兵进来，领我到宫殿去。 	3
61	“不吻，”星孩说，“你的样子太脏,我能吻蛭蛇和癞蛤蟆都不会吻你。” 	2
62	Goodbye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
63	他的脚掌和手掌是金黄色的。 	0
64	她沉到水下，恋恋不舍地看着他。 	1
65	我要把那个可怜的小男孩儿抱到那棵树顶上去，然后我再把这围墙拆掉，让我的花园世世代代成为孩子们的游戏场。” 	0
66	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	4
67	This is a delightful spot, he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." 	0
68	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
69	“你没有对我做什么坏事，可是我不需要你了。” 	1
70	But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.	3
71	Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'	0
72	Even the cattle of the field praise Him.	0
73	我触摸了他的两眼,它们马上瞎了。 	1
74	The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.	1
75	Well, really, exclaimed a small Fireballoon, why not? It is a most joyful occasion.	0
76	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
77	The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the ends fast to two iron stanchions. 	3
78	那是一个冬天，入夜后天冷得更厉害了。	1
79	茶屋传来吉他的弹奏，大烟鬼们苍白的脸上露岀笑容，张望过路的行人。 	0
80	他们伸开瘦巴巴的臂膊，在水里划着沉重的桨。 	1
81	“‘好多人做得不错，’磨坊主回答说，‘可是很少有人说得不错，这说明说话要比做事难得多啊，因此也就是更值得干的事情了。'他隔着桌子严厉地看着他的小儿子，这个小孩儿因此觉得无地自容,把头垂得低低的，满脸通红，眼泪流进了他的茶水里。 	1
82	A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust. 	1
83	Who is there who careth for us?	2
84	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	2
85	Suffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.'	0
86	The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no man has care of us. 	1
87	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
88	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
89	他重重地摔进了浪头里，他的伙伴赶快得得得跑走了。	1
90	一只黑狗朝他跑来汪汪叫唤。 	3
91	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
92	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
93	然后它们仰起鼻孔在空中嗅了嗅，朝相反的方向小跑走了。 	3
94	他果真抽打那个孩子，把孩子打哭了；打完孩子后，他们急匆匆跑出这个城市。 	2
95	郁郁不欢的国王从宫殿的一面窗户注视着他们。 	1
96	Goodbye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.	0
97	他走进了房间，躺在他的小地铺上，开始思念他的情人儿；过了一会儿，他睡着了。 	1
98	Delightful! he cried, I shall go on like this for ever. 	0
99	奴隶们都趴在桨上睡着了。 	1
100	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	1
101	Pretty boy, pretty boy,' she muttered, 'that is a terrible thing to do.'	2
102	“天哪！”鹅大声叫道， 	3
103	至于我的灵魂嘛，如果它横阻在我和我所爰的东西之间,那对我又有什么好处呢？” 	1
104	“她像一朵白玫瑰！”他们呼叫着，纷纷从阳台上往她身上抛花儿。	0
105	And yet I will not wear this robe, nor will I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so will I go forth from it. 	1
106	王子和公主坐在大厅的首席，喝干了一水晶杯酒。	0
107	The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.	4
108	And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.	1
109	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
110	The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. 	0
111	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
112	我从来没有见过哪个人脸色那么苍白。 	3
113	“恐怕我惹他生气了，”绿红雀答道， 	1
114	巨人最爱那小男孩儿，因为小男孩儿亲吻过他。	4
115	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
116	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
117	“我觉得好凉快，”男孩子说，“我一定好多了。”他很快进入了香甜的梦乡。	0
118	他打了它一下，它立即还了一下。 	0
119	哦，再见,听我说没错，能跟你交谈我很高兴。	0
120	“我不是要到埃及去，”燕子说，	1
121	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
122	“她说过，如果我给她带红玫瑰来，她就和我跳舞。”年轻的大学生嚷嚷说,“可是我的花园里哪儿也没有红玫瑰啊。”	1
123	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
124	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
125	One day the Giant came back. 	3
126	He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.	3
127	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	0
128	But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth. 	2
129	On its forehead was a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.	0
130	“我就住那儿去吧。”他叫道，“那是个好去处，新鲜空气有的是。”	0
131	天气确实冷得要命。 	3
132	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
133	她会把他安置在右手边，对着微笑，他再也不会离开她身边，而且会让她和他一起玩耍，教给她所有有趣的小把戏。 	0
134	But he answered them not a word, but passed on, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the gates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the cathedral, the little page running beside him. 	1
135	他再也玩儿不动了，只好坐在他的大扶手椅子里，看孩子们玩儿游戏，观赏他自己的花园。	0
136	他甩了甩头，笑笑。 	0
137	It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.	0
138	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
139	The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.	0
140	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.	1
141	他只是双唇分张，两眼发呆，无所事事地坐在船头,听啊听啊，听得海雾把他悄悄围住，行走的月儿在他那棕色的肢体上撒上一层银色。 	1
142	Strange were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils.	1
143	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flowerdeluce, the Daffodil and the ClovePink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	0
144	我的朋友正在尼罗河上飞来飞去,跟大荷花说话呢。	0
145	如果他们失去了他们唯一的儿子,，非凡的火箭那说什么话也枉然。	1
146	但是她并没有消气，反而取笑他，越说气越大，最后哭泣道：“我们的孩子都没有面包吃，我们还养得起别人的孩子吗？	2
147	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说，你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
148	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.	2
149	Why! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.	0
150	In very truth I will let thee go,' said the young Fisherman.	4
151	Was it Echo?	0
152	The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. 	0
153	Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. 	0
154	那是花园最远的角落,一个小男孩儿正站在那里。	1
155	For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin?	3
156	It is but a day’s journey from this place, and it waits for thy coming.	0
157	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.	0
158	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	1
159	放学后，他们只好绕着那圈高墙转悠，谈论着墙里那美丽的花园。	1
160	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
161	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
162	你母亲没有住在这个城里。	1
163	国王吹笛子吹得很差劲，可是谁也不敢跟他说明这点，因为他是一国之君呀。 	2
164	Alas! my son,' she cried, wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
165	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	0
166	一天早上，老河鼠从他的洞口探出头来。 	3
167	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.	1
168	然而，他统治的时候不长，因为他过去遭受苦难太多，考验他的烈火太猛，他仅仅活了三年就死去了。	1
169	我们在旅行中三次来到奥克苏斯河岸。 	0
170	就这样，星孩和樵夫的孩子一起抚养大了，同他们坐在同一张餐桌旁就餐，同他们一起玩耍。	0
171	附近有一个小城，城里有一座鹅掌楸花园。 	0
172	“她刚才还像一朵白玫瑰，”小侍童对身边的人说，“可是她现在一下子成了一朵红玫瑰了。”整个宫廷听了都很高兴。	0
173	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
174	‘'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller; 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
175	“你有一个人的灵魂，”她回答说，“如果你把你的灵魂打发走。 	1
176	They acted so well, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of the play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears. Indeed some of the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats, and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires, should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.	1
177	小矮人的这一串表演彻底打掉了小公主的庄严，小矮人跑出场子很久了她还在笑个不停，还一个劲儿要求她叔叔让小矮人马上再表演一次。 	0
178	“我不希望争论,青蛙扬扬得意地说， 	0
179	他走啊走啊，一直走到森林的外围,他在这里看见成干上万的人在干河床上劳作。 	1
180	So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.	4
181	努比亚人像一条遭受践踏的蛇一样乱滚乱跳，嘴唇里扑扑冒着红色血沫。 	3
182	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	4
183	He was really very sorry for what he had done.	1
184	闲人莫入，违者法办	3
185	燕子自己思忖道，“他可真是彬彬有礼，连说说个人意见都细声软语的。” 	0
186	And the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the merchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved sword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold.	0
187	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
188	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
189	多么可怕的灾难！	3
190	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
191	As we passed over the mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.	3
192	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
193	‘And what would you do in return?’ said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	0
194	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
195	不过，也得承认，她的声音有时听上去很美。	0
196	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。” 	0
197	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
198	A horrible odour filled the place. 	3
199	“那你还是不哭的好。”	1
200	事情是怎么回事就是怎么回事，眼下实在冷得要命嘛。” 	1
201	野外的鸟儿在树林里飞来飞去，自有它们的自由，	0
202	And the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid the dead things within it.	1
203	你肯定会看见它们的。” 	0
204	它们是用珍贵的蓝宝石做的，是一千年前从印度买来的蓝宝石呢。 	0
205	But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby–studded crown, and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls. 	0
206	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜悯之情。	4
207	I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'	0
208	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
209	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
210	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	0
211	西班牙公主只有十二岁，太阳把宫殿花园照得一片灿烂。 	0
212	你要是跟我在一起多好啊。 	4
213	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
214	我什么都不会给你的，她喃喃地说。	1
215	'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.	2
216	这是美丽的德行，我这种德行可非一日之功。	0
217	你能阻止这些事情发生吗？你愿意和麻风病人同床共寝吗？愿意和乞丐同桌共餐吗？狮子会按你说的做吗？野猪会听从你的命令吗？造成人间苦难的他不比你更精明吗？	2
218	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
