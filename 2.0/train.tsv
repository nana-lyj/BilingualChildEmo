118	Now early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man’s hand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest and knocked three times at the door.	3
119	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受。	1
120	不管怎样他应该去看个究竟。 	3
121	他们用小锡杯上酒,在酒面上撒些玫瑰叶子。 	0
122	‘Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,’ said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cartwheel went over it.	2

135	第二天，魔术师来到他跟前，说:“今天你要是不把那块黄金给我带来，那我肯定要把你当奴隶使唤，抽你三百鞭子。”	3
136	Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch for couch.	1
137	按宫廷御医说，那个生下他的白人姑娘是死于悲伤或瘟疫；而另有人则说是用一杯配制好的意大利烈性毒酒让她服下，不到一小时就活活弄死了她;那个可靠的信差，把这孩子放在鞍子前面就跑了，等他跳下疲劳的马、敲开牧羊人小屋的柴门时，公主的尸体正在往挖开的墓穴里放。	3

139	她把火柴掉进臭水沟里，火柴都弄坏了。	1

141	I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.	2

143	“得得得，是我说到焰火技术的，”火箭说，口气十分严厉，信号焰火觉得当头挨了一棒，立即对身边的小爆筒开始吹胡子瞪眼睛，显示他不管怎样都是有身份的人物。 	2
144	But he said to them, 'I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who bare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.	1
145	And wherever the Star–Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star–Child bade them do, that did they.	4
146	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
147	The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal–burners speaking—the Comprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase him. But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage. He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved her. Perhaps she was in the room beyond.	3
148	为什么我会需要你？”捕鱼的小伙子叫道，“不过你爱怎样就怎样吧。”他说完跳进了水中，人鱼海神吹响他们的号角，小美人鱼浮上水面与他相会，用她的双臂勾住他的脖子，亲吻他的嘴。 	4
149	“你要是跟我在一起真是再好不过呀。 	4
150	He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.	1
151	芦苇一贯喜欢下雨, 可那完全是为了她自己。” 	1
152	“别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	0
153	Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'	4
154	But the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was undoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf. 	0
155	‘What a curious thing!’ he cried; ‘there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.	0
156	Charming! charming!	0
157	It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.’	1
158	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
159	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
160	他有一对贼亮的圆溜溜的眼睛，硬刷刷的灰胡子，尾巴长得像一截长长的黑橡皮。 	3
161	And the young Fisherman went down into the market–place, and he walked slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.	1
162	‘This is a delightful spot,’ he said, ‘we must ask the Hail on a visit.’ 	0
163	“给我一粒吧，”死亡说，“我把它种在花园里；只要一颗，我马上就走。” 	3

165	“因为他的心碎了。”宫廷大臣说。 	1
166	你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
167	北风用皮外衣裹得严严实实，整天都在花园里呜呜叫个不停,把烟囱都刮倒了。	1
168	“天怎么下起棍子雨了？”她赶紧跳进水里去了。	3
169	What a success I am!	0
170	“来吧！我们去参拜吧。”巫婆小声说,她领着他走过去,而且在她恳求他时,一种强烈的参拜欲望紧紧抓住了他，他于是跟着她走去。 	0
171	‘I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,’ remarked the Duck; ‘there are so many things that need reforming.	0
172	And she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green viper’s skin, and gave it to him.	3
173	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
174	“是呀，这也正是我想知道的。”鸭妈妈说；她游到水塘的另一头，一头扎进水里倒立起来，让她的孩子们好好学学她的样子。 	0
175	‘My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotusflowers.	0
176	For accursed were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.'	2

178	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
179	“五块金子，”他说，“还有我的网子、我住的那所篱笆房子，以及我出海用的油漆船。 	0
180	“哎呀！一罐金子落下来了，谁拾到就是谁的。”他们嚷嚷说着，就开始跑起来，迫不及待地想得到金子。 	0
181	The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of them in the throat. 	3
182	‘I don't think much of that,’ said the Duck, ‘as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
183	她的歌儿越来越细弱，她觉得有什么东西堵住了她的喉咙。	3
184	Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the colliedog, that would be something.’	2
185	Then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.	3
186	So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star–Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.	0
187	She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.	0
188	月亮升上天空时，他飞回到快乐王子身边。	0
189	What need should I have of thee?' cried the young Fisherman, 'but be it as thou wilt,' and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their horns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the mouth.	4
190	“我的玫瑰是黄色的，”玫瑰树回答说，黄得像坐在琥珀御座上的美人鱼的头发，甚至比割草人挥起大镰刀割过的草地中的黄水仙还鲜黄。	0
191	‘'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy today.	1
192	In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.’	2
193	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
194	‘It is your garden now, little children,’ said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. 	0
195	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
196	Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.	0
197	“那僧侣向我求救，说：'大人您快把奴仆的眼睛治好吧，我会把神指给你看的。' 	4
198	“我的玫瑰是红色的，”玫瑰树回答说，红得像鸽子的爪子，甚至比海洋深洞里的珊瑚大扇叶还要红。	0
199	Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	4
200	然而星孩呆在原地一动不动，对她完全关上了心扉，除了那女人痛苦的哭泣声外，别的什么也没听到。	1
201	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	0
202	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，她就会和我一直跳到天亮。	0
203	When I saw that, I knew who the woman was, and wherefore she had smiled at me.	1
204	But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.	4
205	And the Priest trembled, and returned to his own house and prayed.	3
206	But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.	1
207	于是他们进了城，走过街道，就在穿过珠宝商街时，捕鱼的小伙子看见一个摊位上摆着一个银杯， 	0
208	Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, "but you are more beautiful than your picture", and the little Princess blushed.	4
209	“这是一个令人愉快的地方，”北风说，“我们一定要请冰雹来访冋。”	0
210	可是星孩说：不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
211	但是小矮人没有理她们。 	2
212	He stood there in a king’s raiment, and the Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move. 	0
213	贫穷从我们不见阳光的小巷溜进来，瞪着饥饿的眼睛；罪恶面无表情地接踵而来。	3
214	Nought but that,' she answered, and she smiled at him again.	0
215	Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.	0
216	不过还是接着讲你的故事。 	1
217	“我是快乐王子。”	0
218	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
219	This is magnificent, cried the Rocket, "they are going to let me off in broad daylight, so that every one can see me."	0
220	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.	3
221	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
222	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
223	“可我如何报答你呢，”星孩说，“你瞧！这可是你第三次救我了啊！”	4
224	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
225	And he said to her, 'Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.	1

227	瞧瞧你们还笑，找快活，仿佛王子和公主根本没有结婚似的。 	2
228	他对疆鼠说：“你能钻到地下去。快告诉我，我母亲在那里吗？” 	4
229	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
230	They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.	2
231	啦，就是卖掉它也得不到一分钱。 	1
232	The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the dogs. 	1
233	真正的爱是受熬煎，是沉默无语。	1
234	Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, I am in great trouble.	1
235	One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.	0
236	“我还能给他送去一颗红宝石吗？ ” 	1
237	他老婆开了门，看见她丈夫平安回到身边，便把两条胳膊缠在丈夫脖子上亲吻丈夫，接着从他背上取下那捆柴火，扫掉他靴子上的雪，要他进屋子里来。	0
238	母亲，我当初拒绝了你。	1
239	那天下午孩子们跑进来时，发现巨人躺在那棵树下死了，身上盖满了白色的鲜花。	1
240	Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller, friendship never forgets.	4
241	Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her dress as she walked.	0
242	They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.	2
243	One morning the old Waterrat put his head out of his hole.	0
244	他们打开一道象牙制作的门，我发现自己走进了一个有七层露台的花园，园中流水潺潺。 	0
245	My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	0
246	‘'Little Hans, Doctor.'	0
247	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
248	朝臣这下全乐了，有人索性冲他大声喊：“陛下，人民在等待自己的国王，你却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒火顿生，说：“他为我们国家带来耻辱,不配做我们的一国之君。”	2
249	Should I not love also?' asked his Soul.	4
250	小汉斯呀，大夫。‘ 	4
251	尼罗河没有泛滥，祭士们都在诅咒伊西斯回和奥西里斯図。	1
252	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
253	The riverhorse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.	0
254	我对你别无所求，只求你做一个痴心情郎，因为爱情远比哲学更智慧虽然哲学就够智慧了,比权力更强大虽然权力就够强大了。	4
255	她们的脚用指甲花着了色，手里拿着小铜铃。 	0
256	这地方气候干燥，赤日炎炎。 	1
257	“我在寻找我的母亲，”他回答说,“我求求你放我进去，也许她就在这城里呢。”	4
258	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。”	4
259	She is like a white rose! they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.	0
260	“今天是安息日，他会到那里去的。” 	0
261	They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.	0
262	可是孩子们说他们并不知道他住在哪里，过去从来也没有见过他；巨人觉得伤心极了。	1
263	“走开！走开！”神父嚷道，“你的情人迷途了，你和她在一起也会迷途的。” 	2
264	They took hostages, and told us that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till then.	3
265	鸟儿落在树上，唱起悦耳的歌儿，孩子们不由得停下游戏聆听鸟儿们歌唱。	0
266	一个转轮焰火忧心忡忡地说。	1
267	“过了一会儿，他和我搭话，问我有什么要求。 	4
268	So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young Fisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.	0
269	“不必多提，毕竟是你首先心疼我的呀。”兔子说，它转眼就跑走了。	4
270	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	0
271	这时樵夫的小女儿走到他身边，把手搭在他肩上，说，即使你真的失去了你的美貌，那又有什么关系呢？	4
272	I like the Miller immensely.	0
273	‘It is but a ring of lead,’ he cried, ‘nor has it any value.	1
274	Do thou give me love.	4
275	In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.	1
276	When the Emperor saw me, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped.	3
277	When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land.	3
278	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。	0
279	And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.	1
280	‘Ahem! ahem!’ said the Rocket, and he began to cough.	2
281	The world is wide, and there is Heaven also, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between.	3
282	Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?	0
283	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
284	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
285	‘Ahem! ahem!’ said the Rocket angrily.	2
286	花园里唯一感到高兴的人是雪和霜。	0
287	墙上覆盖了一块粉色的卢卡花缎，上面有鸟的图案，还点缀着俏丽的银色花朵;家具是用银子堆成的，装饰着华丽的花冠和转动的丘比特；两个大壁炉前都摆放着绣有鹦鹉和孔雀的大型屏风；地是用海绿色玛瑙砌的，一眼看去延伸到了很远的地方。 	0
288	那花儿长着紫叶子，花心有一个星星，汁液像牛奶一样乳白。 	0
289	The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.	0
290	And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress, he rose up in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, 'My son, is this a king’s apparel? And with what crown shall I crown thee, and what sceptre shall I place in thy hand? Surely this should be to thee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement.'	0
291	面粉是一种东西，友谊是另一种东西，这两样东西是不能混为一谈的。 	2
292	回声能模仿声音，也能模仿眼睛吗？ 	3
293	Phew!' they cried, as they lit upon the ground, 'there is some one here we know not!' and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs. Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind.	3
294	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
295	Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.’ 	4
296	I hate people who cry over spilt milk.	2
297	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
298	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
299	And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'	1
300	Accept me in the hour of my humility.	1
301	多么遗憾啊！	1
302	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.	3
303	我们坐在那里正在兴头上，一个老人朝我们走来,他拿着一块皮毯子和一把有两只琥珀角的鲁特琴。 	0
304	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说，快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
305	我们走到蛇楼前,用玻璃碗给它们盛热牛奶，它们就放我们过去了。 	0
306	在扁平的卵形盾上堆放着玉石，有红葡萄酒色，也有草绿色。 	0
307	The walls are cased with copper, and the watch–towers on the walls are roofed with brass.	0
308	他的同伴们追随他，因为他漂亮，腿脚快，能跳舞，会吹奏，写曲子。	0
309	他疲乏地爬下绳梯，消失在海中。	1
310	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	4
311	他把小伙子留在身边使唤,他用清水洗过澡后，打开了一个大油漆箱子，从中取出他的皮革腰衣和粗羊皮袍,那是他在山坡上放牧羊人的羊群时穿的衣服。 	0
312	And when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went back to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.	1
313	Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.	0
314	“爰情更好。”捕鱼的小伙子回答说，他一头扎进深海里，灵魂哭泣着从沼泽地上离去了。 	1
315	然而，整个上午的娱乐活动中最最精彩的，当属那个小矮人的舞蹈。 	0
316	His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.	0
317	在花园最远的角落，一棵树开满了可爰的白花儿。	0
318	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
319	This it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.	1
320	And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. 	0
321	The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.	0
322	浪花从海浪里接过它，浪沫从浪花里接过它，海岸最终接住了它，捕鱼的小伙子在自己的脚边看见小美人鱼的尸体躺在那里。 	1
323	I would send my soul away from me,' answered the young Fisherman.	1
324	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
325	她看出来她没法脱身，只好小声跟他说：“我长得一定和海的女儿一样好看,也和那些生活在蓝色水域的人一样清秀。”她冲他皱起眉头，把脸凑近他的脸。 	1
326	但是那刺儿还没有戳到她的心,所以玫瑰的心还是白的，偏偏只有但写的心血才能将玫瑰的心染红了。 	1
327	He wandered all round looking for some place through which he might gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private door that was lying open.	0
328	因此，快让我们的君主戴上这顶皇冠，拿上这根权杖，以我们国王的公正和慈悲来统治我们吧。”	0
329	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
330	她比晨星还漂亮，比月亮还洁白。 	0
331	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你愿意和我呆上一个夜晚，给我当当送信人吗？ 	4
332	你说得多好啊！'磨坊主的老婆一边说，一边给自己倒了一大杯热乎乎的啤酒，‘我真有点困了，都快睡着了。 	0
333	And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god.	1
334	He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as cold as ice.	0
335	Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells.	0
336	And when he saw the Star–Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, 'Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.	3
337	我们还是别理他，走我们的路吧，瞧瞧我们都是穷人，有自己的孩子要面包吃,给不起别的孩子的。” 	1
338	所以去把它取来吧，世界的财富就都是你的了。” 	0
339	你不是说你把它卖了吗？干那种事可是很愚蠢的！' 	2
340	他的灵魂回答他说：“不是这个城市，是另一个。 	1
341	Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city.’	2
342	丝绸床罩上绣着淡白罂粟花，仿佛它们是从入睡者疲劳的手里落下来的；高高的槽形象牙细柱子把天鹅绒华盖支撑起来，华盖上翻上去一束束硕大的鸵鸟羽毛，如白色泡沫，直指银白色的回纹装饰天花板。 	0
343	“无上荣耀呀！”全体朝臣纷纷道贺说。	0
344	“国王的儿子真叫走运，”他说，“他结婚的那天我正好被燃放。	0
345	那声音十分迷人,，非凡的火箭大家都躺在床上不睡，听我们唱歌。 	0
346	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
347	在御座的第二个台阶上放着小公主的跪凳，垫子是用银丝布做的,跪凳下面、华盖外边，摆着教皇使节的椅子，专供教皇使节在国王出席各种公共庆典场合下使用,他那顶红衣主教帽子上红缨子盘结在一起，放在前面一个紫色矮凳上。 	0
348	起初花儿苍白得像悬浮在河面上的薄雾一苍白得像早晨的纤脚，然后它变成了银白色，活像拂晓的双翼。	0
349	The young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and watched him. 	0
350	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
351	As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.	0
352	但是那麻风病人一言不发。	1
353	It was the night before the day fixed for his coronation, and the young King was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber. 	1
354	巨龟在热泥中躺着睡觉。 	1
355	门道旁神龛中睡觉的人兽神有了它那睡觉的享生兄弟，银质维纳斯站在阳光下朝和她一样可爱的维纳斯伸出手臂。 	4
356	The chief smiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.	0
357	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
358	Now when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran out into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.	0
359	所以你别哭了。	4
360	神像是用象牙雕刻的，有人像的两倍大。 	3
361	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
362	它右手握着一根带钩的翡翠权杖，另一只手里拿着一个圆水晶球。 	0
363	“你们在这里干什么？”他喊叫道,声音很霸道，孩子们赶紧跑散了。	2
364	但是他对他们说：我不配啊，因为我不认我的亲生母亲，在我找到她，求得她的原谅之前，我是不会心安的。	1
365	“你是最好的巫婆啊，”捕鱼的小伙子大声说，“我今夜一定要和你在山头上跳舞。 	0
366	“'这板子不怎么大呀，'磨坊主打量着板子说，'恐怕我堵上我的仓库顶后就留不下你修理手推车的料了；不过这当然不是我的错。 	1
367	在场的每个人都兴趣盎然，他们神态庄严地在多姿多态的舞姿中穿插走动，徐缓的动作和大方的躬身行礼都显得极为优雅，那样子太迷人了；等他们完成了表演，向小公主脱下他们的大羽毛帽子致敬时，小公主也毕恭毕敬地频频还礼，并且一口保证送一支大蜡烛给德•彼拉圣母的神龛，报答圣母赐给她这一欢乐。 	0
368	But the young Fisherman laughed.	0
369	A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes, answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper, and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
370	巨人看着这幕景致，心融化了。	4
371	‘'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his nightcap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	1
372	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。 	1
373	I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a threestoried house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.'	0
374	于是他们匆匆上路，他们披星戴月走了整整一个晚上，第二天他们又顶着烈日走了整整一天，当天晚上他们走到一座城市前。 	1
375	He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.	0
376	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
377	因为花园里没有孩子们，鸟儿不愿意在里面唱歌，桃树也忘记开花了。	1
378	Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.	2
379	“你有什么要求？”巫婆发问，走到了他跟前。 	4
380	And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.	1
381	可是别提灵魂，它对我们毫无用处，对我们的行当也毫无价值。” 	1
382	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
383	‘The Prince gives a ball tomorrow night,’ murmured the young Student, ‘and my love will be of the company.	4
384	他们过去在树林里就经常看见他，他要么像精灵追逐旋落的叶子那样跳舞，要么蹲在某棵老橡树的洞里和松鼠们分享坚果儿。 	0
385	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
386	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道。	2
387	‘Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘will you not stay with me one night longer?’	4
388	去年夏天，我在河边呆着时,两个野男孩儿，就是磨坊主的儿子，总是用石头砸我。	2
389	‘But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.	1
390	Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters,' and she fawned on him and put her face close to his.	4
391	但是要饭的女人一言不发。 	1
392	回声能弄出一个活像这真世界的世界吗？ 	0
393	 'He is a man like myself. 	4
394	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the noticeboard it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
395	几分钟后，禁卫兵队长解散了那些士兵。 	1
396	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
397	You would be quite blind then.’	3
398	“可我要是能帮助你该多好啊。”捕鱼的小伙子说。 	4
399	The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance.	0
400	谁得到这个戒指，就比这世界上所有的国王都富有。 	0
401	我要去'死神殿'了。	3
402	他于是走到水井旁，往下看去，瞧呀!他的脸果真像癞蛤蟆的脸，他的身上像蛭蛇一样长满了鳞片。	3
403	我们都有几手专长，这就够吃遍天下了。 	0
404	“你在说你自己呢。”焰火筒回答说。 	2
405	小松鼠在杉树上过着孤单的生活，他对小松鼠说：“我的母亲在哪里呢？”	1
406	The love of the body is vile,' cried the Priest, knitting his brows, 'and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world. Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea! I have heard them at night–time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads. They tap at the window, and laugh. They whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.	2
407	他是多么希望同她一起回树林去啊！ 	1
408	And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, 'What robe is this that thou art weaving?'	3
409	Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.	4
410	And the Linnet answered, Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
411	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
412	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
413	连公爵夫人人们称她为“管家市长”这位围着黄绉领的铁面瘦女人都不像平常那样气势汹汹的，皱巴巴的脸上掠过几丝冷笑,两片没有血色的薄嘴唇咧了咧。 	3
414	那确实是一幕让人惊喜的景色。	0
415	有一次他们陷进了深雪坑,挣脱出来就像正在磨面的磨工那样子白了；有一次他们滑进了池水结冰的光滑冰面上，他们的柴火摔散了捆，他们只好把柴火捡起来，重捆在一起；又有一次他们以为迷了路，心下害怕得要命，因为他们知道雪对任何睡在它们怀里的人都毫不留情。	3
416	‘He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.’	1
417	And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night–time he spake her name.	4
418	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	1
419	And the Queen said to him, 'This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.'	4
420	所以我对你所干的事情不赞成，劝你掉转马头回宫,让自己脸上高兴起来，穿上那套适合国王身份的衣服，戴上那顶我将为你加冕的皇冠，拿起那根我将交付你手的珍珠权杖。 	0
421	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
422	In the market–place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and yellow as topazes, citrons and rose–apples and clusters of white grapes, round red–gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.	0
423	他们都极讲实际，一旦反对什么，一概称之为蒙人。 	2
424	“那个僧侣恳求我说：'大人您快把奴仆的手治好吧，我会把您引荐给神的。' 	4
425	“嗨哟嗨哟！ ”他们每拽出一只箱子就喊一声。 	0
426	And I answered him, ‘I will go for half of thy treasure.	0
427	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
428	他们转了一圈又一圈，年轻的巫婆跳得很高很高，他都能看见她的鞋子的红后跟儿了。 	0
429	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.	4
430	于是他赶紧跑过去，弯下腰用手去拿，原来是一件金丝织的斗篷，精巧地绣着许多星星，叠了许多折。	0
431	他害怕起来，赶紧把手闪开，那妖怪的手也赶紧闪开了。 	3
432	我用一只转轮能把月亮从天上拉下来，我还能让你在水晶里看见死神。 	3
433	他从放这两样东西的柜子里取出斗篷和琥珀链子，拿给她看。 	0
434	“他奇丑无比，我们生活的地方根本不能允许他玩耍郁金香大声说。 	1
435	我们从树上摘了熟石榴，掰开它们喝它们的甜汁儿。 	0
436	他穿着漂亮的王服，站立在他们面前，风琴弹岀了乐曲，号手吹响了他们的号角，童子唱起了圣诗。	0
437	在屋子角落的床上，她的小孩儿躺着生病。 	1
438	 'Is it so, indeed?' he questioned. 	0
439	那里种着郁金香和月光花，还有银星点点的沉香。 	0
440	He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.	3
441	They threw us bread over the walls, little maize–cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.	0
442	And Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the forest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of flame. 	3
443	一点不假，他有时会怀念起他在森林中无拘无束的生活，会又寸每天占去许多时间的宫廷繁礼缠节动辄大发脾气，但这令人入迷的宫殿如人称所谓的“欢乐宫”似乎是他寻欢觅乐的全新世界,他发现自己成了宫中的君王。但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。 	0
444	他们拍打窗户，放声大笑。 	0
445	他回答我说：'这就是神。 	4
446	”这块土地是自由的，”年轻的国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”	0
447	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
448	So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	0
449	于是他修建了一堵髙墙，把花园围起来，还挂上一块牌子： 	3
450	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
451	“有人开始赏识我了，”他惊叫道，这一定是某个了不起的崇拜者送来的。	0
452	他的双翼是火焰色的，他的身体像火焰一样有色彩。	0
453	一天早上，巨人醒来躺在床上，这时他听见了一种美妙的乐曲。	0
454	那个年轻人两手把头抱得紧紧的,一点没有听见燕子扑棱翅膀的声音，他抬头看时才发现那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在那些枯萎的紫罗兰上面。	0
455	‘Goodbye, dear Prince!’ he murmured, ‘will you let me kiss your hand?’	4
456	‘What a dreadful storm it was!	3
457	我这下把风头岀尽了！	0
458	He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords. 	0
459	“不，”他回答说，“你不把秘密告诉我，我不会放你走的。” 	3
460	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
461	Romance never dies.	4
462	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	4
463	‘Let me tell you a story on the subject,’ said the Linnet.	0
464	我不是你的儿子，用不着听你说三道四。	2
465	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
466	‘No, little Swallow,’ said the poor Prince, ‘you must go away to Egypt.’	1
467	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
468	The man fell sprawling on the floor, and when he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the couch.	3
469	She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.	1
470	“你必须和我跳舞，漂亮的小伙子。”她小声说，且边说边冲他微笑。 	0
471	我的臣子都叫我“快乐王子”，而且我也的确很幸福，如果开心就是幸福的话。	0
472	但是商人们纷纷取笑他，说：“人的灵魂对我们有什么用呢？它连一个银毫子也不值。 	2
473	我走进去时，他们把我身后的门一道道关上，用铁链拴上。 	3
474	‘You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,’ cried the Student.	0
475	商人虐待我们，我们必须对他们言听计从。	3
476	What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
477	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
478	And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.	1
479	然后我们躺在我们的毯子上，等待黎明。 	0
480	‘Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain.	3
481	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
482	你是老几，竟敢给上帝的世界带来痛苦？	2
483	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
484	离天亮还有三个小时，夜幕依然黑沉沉的，他的灵魂却弄醒他，对他说：“快起来到商人的房间去，就到他睡觉的那间屋子，把他杀了，拿走他的金子，我们需要金子。” 	3
485	其中一个妇女戴着一个镶金的皮面具。 	3
486	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说，	2
487	其实只是一只小红雀儿在窗外唱歌，但是因为他很久没有听见鸟儿在他的花园里唱歌，所以他觉得这是人世间最美丽的音乐。	0
488	“于是我朝他眼睛吹了一口气，眼睛就复明了；僧侣又战战兢兢地领着我走进第三个隔间，瞧啊！里面竟然没有神像,什么样子的形象都没有,只有一面圆铜镜子摆放在一个石头祭坛上。 	3
489	One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.	1
490	“不，什么都不如财富好。”灵魂说。 	0
491	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	1
492	后来，燕子飞回到了快乐王子身边，跟快乐王子讲了他做过的事。 	0
493	不过这是要开价的，漂亮的小伙子,这是要开价的。 	1
494	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	1
495	All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her lifeblood ebbed away from her.	1
496	Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.	0
497	蜥蜴生来绝对是哲学家的材料，常常坐在那里一想就想几个小时，只要他们无别的事可做，或是天气阴雨连绵，他们无法外岀的时候。 	1
498	As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads together. 	0
499	不管哪路商人在他们城里逗留,他们都按这一规矩做生意。 	0
500	新娘和新郎将要一起跳玫瑰舞，国王已答应吹笛伴乐。 	0
501	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
502	And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.	3
503	“我一直表现得多么自私啊！"他说，现在我明白了为什么舂天不到这里来了。 	1
504	‘I am going to Egypt’! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.	1
505	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!” 	1
506	Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.	1
507	他在所有事情上都左右着他们，他们都变得铁石心肠，和他完全一样。 	2
508	浪漫这东西是老皇历了。” 	1
509	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
510	‘It is not comfortable here,’ he remarked, ‘but no doubt it is some fashionable wateringplace, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
511	'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	3
512	May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?’	3
513	他的头发焦黄干涩，嘴唇红得如石榴，眼睛很大的却混沌不清。 	1
514	Art thou a spy set on us by our master?'	3
515	等他来到魔术师的住宅，魔术师给他打开门，让他进来，对他说：“你把那块白金带来了吗？” 	0
516	“你当时在他身上发现什么标志没有？”她大声问道， 	2
517	“快去那个城市把那两件最珍贵的东西给我捡来。”上帝对他的一个天使说;天使给他拣来了那颗铅心和那只死鸟。 	3
518	随后他们把塑像扔进炉里化掉了，市长专门召开市政会议，决定如何处理融化的铁。 	3
519	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
520	As he did so, the figure moved out also, and he saw it plainly.	3
521	“如果你想给别人快乐，”焰火筒大声说， 	0

531	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.	1
532	He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.	3
533	黑滚滚的海浪涌向海岸，上面托浮着一样比银子还白的物体。 	3
534	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
535	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
536	随后，那个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人手持盾牌大声喊叫说：“我的君主怎么能说他不美丽呢？” 	0
537	他回答说：“我母亲是一个要饭的,就和我一样，我很恶劣地对待过她，我求你让我进去，她也许会原谅我，要是她真的呆在这座城里的话。” 	4

540	Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.	0
541	他朝它鞠了一个嘲弄的躬，它也朝他鞠一个嘲弄的躬。 	2
542	来和我一起玩儿吧，我不会取笑你的。	4
543	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
544	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	4
545	When midnight sounded from the clock–tower he touched a bell, and his pages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose–water over his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow. 	0
546	Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.	1
547	At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.	1
548	Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. 	1
549	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
550	And when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, 'I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that I may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom I love has her dwelling.	4
551	捕鱼的小伙子笑起来。 	0
552	The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle. 	3
553	七年期间，他把想说的话都说了，因为他的谈话是有限的，于是他决意返回他自己的城堡来。 	1
554	星孩于是走向树林，花了整整一天时间搜寻那块黄金，但是怎么找也找不到。	1
555	神在用餐。'他大声说。 	3
556	‘'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	4
557	He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.	0
558	Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other. 	3
559	“我的心是我的恋人的，”他回答说，“用不着犹豫，只让你离开就行了。” 	2
560	他的船装满鱼时，美人鱼就沉到水下，朝他微笑。 	0
561	当然当然；我知道一谈到有趣的话题，就准有人横加打断。 	2
562	我上一次见到他们,他们还在争吵昵。	2
563	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
564	所以我不再引诱你了，但是我只求你让我进入你的心,这样我就像过去一样跟你在一起了。” 	4
565	From the tea–houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the opium–smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers–by.	0
566	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
567	Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.	0
568	既然你有了机会，你就要充分利用，因为我过不了多一会儿就要回宫中了。 	1
569	但是他们不让进，还用他们的长矛刺他。	2
570	You are a very irritating person, said the Rocket, and very illbred.	2
571	However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.	0
572	在市场上，水果贩子各占其位，兜售各种水果：熟无花果泛着深紫深紫的颜色，甜瓜味如麝香，色如黄玉。另有香槻、红苹果、一串串白葡萄、金黄的圆橘、青金色卵形柠檬。 	0
573	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
574	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
575	But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.	4
576	It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.	0
577	In all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his.	0
578	A short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings.	0
579	At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he blows through a horn of horn.	0
580	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
581	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.’	0
582	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant, tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.	2
583	幸亏本人我不在乎。 	1
584	玫瑰树顶端花枝上的那朵玫瑰花哟，开得仿佛一面银镜里的玫瑰花影,又好像水池里一朵玫瑰的倒影。	0
585	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
586	And his Soul mocked him and said, 'Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love.	1
587	He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.	0
588	And suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished steel. 	3
589	“'我们在冬天经常谈到你，汉斯，'磨坊主说,'不知道你日子过得怎么样。” 	4
590	Thy mother dwells not in this city.	1
591	The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.	0
592	他抽搐了一阵儿，接着就一动不动了。	3
593	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	0
594	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
595	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
596	我的两只脚固定在这底座上了，我不能动啊。	1
597	I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'	0
598	“这是因为你干了一件好事啊。”王子说。	0
599	Canst thou make these things not to be? Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board? Shall the lion do thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee? Is not He who made misery wiser than thou art?	3
600	一层薄薄的红晕岀现在玫瑰的叶子里，宛如新郎初吻新娘的柔唇时脸上露出的潮红。	4
601	Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.	1
602	Surely thou shouldst have been with me.	1
603	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
604	哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	1
605	The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.	0
606	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
607	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
608	“说到这个话题，我来给你讲一个故事吧。”绿红雀说。 	0
609	I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.	0
610	And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.	0
611	东方的每件事都充满智慧。 	0
612	“你的画像很美丽他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。 	0
613	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
614	然而网子里根本没有鱼儿，也没有什么怪物或骇人的东西，只有一个小美人鱼躺在里面熟睡。 	3
615	But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.	1
616	但是，小矮人真的难以抗拒，西班牙宫廷虽然历来以高雅的对于恐怖的激情而著称，却也从来没有见过这样好看好玩儿的小怪物。 	0
617	“快让我看看，瞧瞧这家要什么没什么，我们需要的东西太多了。” 	2
618	他走出集市，走到海岸边，开始盘算他下一步怎么办。 	1
619	When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the house, but it was no longer there.	1
620	“后来呢？”河鼠等了好一会儿，问道。 	1
621	她走得疲惫不堪，就在一棵栗子树下坐下来休息。	1
622	‘The god is asleep,’ he murmured.	1
623	‘You had really better keep yourself dry,’ said the Fireballoon.	2
624	‘I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.’	0
625	“在战争中，”织工回答说，“强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
626	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
627	王子和公主从此再没有幸福可言，他们的婚姻生活全都蒙上了阴影,至于国王，我知道他简直过不了这关。	1
628	‘I have many beautiful flowers,’ he said; ‘but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.’	4
629	他们俩双双沉入海里时，灵魂在沼泽地里哭泣着离去了。 	1
630	他们终于脱险，因此高兴得不知怎么才好，哈哈大笑起来，大地在他们看来像一朵银花，月亮则像一朵金花。	0
631	“世上还真有不折不扣的情种，”夜莺说， 	4
632	“哎！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，我只有这双眼睛了。	1
633	Their fat bodies swayed as they walked, and they glanced curiously at me with their yellow–lidded eyes.	3
634	苦难在一大早就把我们弄醒，耻辱夜里和我们坐在一起。	1
635	我讨厌那些夸夸其谈、口口声声离不开自己的人，你就这个德性；人家都还想谈谈自己呢，我就是这样。 	2
636	But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.	3
637	“我什么也不会给你贪婪说着,把手藏进她衣服的褶子里了。 	1
638	So he sat him down in the market–place and rested, and after a time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.	0
639	Are we not all kinsmen?' said the merchant.	4
640	She was like a white rose before, said a young Page to his neighbour, "but she is like a red rose now", and the whole Court was delighted.	0
641	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
642	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
643	A cold mist followed her, and the water–snakes ran by her side. 	3
644	然而没有人看见他。	1
645	‘I am going to the House of Death.	3
646	随后他打开圣龛，对着里面的圣体匣焚香，向人们展示洁净的圣饼，接着把它放在纱幕后面，开始向人们布道，本想向他们讲出上帝的神谴。 	0
647	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	4
648	He could make little cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.	0
649	但是美人鱼始终没有浮出海面来与他相会。他在大海别的任何地方也找不到她，尽管他找遍了大海的河流，找遍了海浪下的沟谷；在夜色使海水变紫的海中寻找，在黎明使海水变得灰蒙蒙的海水中寻找。 	1
650	我们整天为他们卖苦力，他们在金库里堆砌金子，我们的孩子们过早夭折了，我们热爰的那些人的脸变得冷酷而邪恶。	2
651	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
652	And after a time she clenched her hands in anger.	2
653	The adders hissed at him as he went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch. 	3
654	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
655	‘Tell it to me,’ said the Nightingale, ‘I am not afraid.’	3
656	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
657	我回答说我是伊斯兰教托钵僧，赶往麦加城去朝圣，那里有一条绿纱巾，天使们用双手把《古兰经》全都绣在上面了，每个字都银光闪闪的。 	0
658	他脸上盖着一块灰色的麻布头巾，从小网眼儿里他的眼睛闪射出灼人的光芒。 	3
659	“'没问题。'小汉斯大声说，跑进小屋里把那块木板拖了岀来。  	0
660	一匹戴着银鞍具的小马跑来迎接他。 	0
661	小燕子于是围着芦苇飞啊，飞啊，用翅膀轻轻触动水面，激起一圈圈银色的涟漪。	0
662	她哗啦哗啦摇着大扇子，拍了几下。 	0
663	And the Squirrel answered, Thou hast slain mine.	2
664	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
665	一天晚上他喊出来她，说：“小小美人鱼呀，小小美人鱼，我爱上你了。 	4
666	在整个乡下就数他的花园生机盎然。 	0
667	If they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.	0
668	阿富汗人把那头黑公牛杀死了,正往战场开赴。 	1
669	我怎么能飞起来呢？ 	1
670	他往镜子里一看，见是他自己的脸,不禁大叫一声醒了过来，耀眼的阳光照进了屋子，花园和游乐园的树上传来鸟儿的鸣叫。	0
671	‘You have talked the whole time yourself.	2
672	‘Well, really,’ exclaimed a small Fireballoon, ‘why not? It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.	0
673	他一次又一次浮上来，每一次上来他都带来一颗美丽的珍珠。 	0
674	他们把该干的活儿干完后，商人把他们的稀罕商品陈列岀来，其中有埃及蜡染亚麻布、埃塞俄比亚国的彩染亚麻布、提尔港的紫色海绵和西顿港的蓝色悬挂物；还有冷色琥珀杯、玻璃精制器皿和奇形怪状的烧土器皿。 	0
675	‘'Ah'! said the Miller, 'there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.'	0
676	天气冷得岀奇，连动物和鸟儿都不知道怎样对付下去了。	3
677	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
678	屋子是空的。 	1
679	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
680	And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions through the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most fantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy laughter, and stood all round him and watched him.	0
681	When they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.	3
682	The palms of his feet and hands were yellow with saffron.	0
683	我告诉他们我所干过的事后，他们每个人都送给我一个神像，求我离开他们。 	1
684	一抹淡淡的茉莉花香从敞开的窗子飘了进来。	0
685	It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.	0
686	However, I don't care a bit.	0
687	那些男孩儿都身穿白天鹅绒古式宫廷服装，他们那古怪的三角帽垂悬着银穗子，上面插满了硕大的鸵鸟羽毛；他们在阳光下翩翩起舞，他们那耀眼的白色服装在他们黝黑的脸和长长的黑头发映衬下，显得更加醒目。 	0
688	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
689	But he remembered his dreams, and he said to his lords: 'Take these things away, for I will not wear them. '	2
690	‘Order! order!’ cried out a Cracker.	2
691	Three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them.	3
692	他欣喜若狂，一把抓住它，对兔子说："我为你效了点儿劳，你却成倍地补偿了我；我对你发了点儿善，你还我的有百倍之多啊。”	0
693	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
694	沉重的眼皮从眼睛上垂下来。 	1
695	你不是我们当中的一员。 	1
696	他只是在昨天才刚刚被人发现，当时他正在森林里野跑，两个贵族碰巧在城周围一大片软木林子的一个偏远角落打猎，撞见他后就把他带进宫殿,想给小公主一个惊喜；他的父亲本是一个贫穷的烧炭翁，巴不得打发掉这个奇丑无比、毫无用处的孩子。 	1
697	钟楼响起午夜钟声时，他按响了铃,他的侍从进来毕恭毕敬地给他宽衣解带,给他倒上玫瑰水洗手，往他的枕头上撤了花瓣儿。 	0
698	这根本不是交谈。	2
699	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
700	“'亲爱的小汉斯，'磨坊主说，'你把这袋面粉给我背到市场上好吗？'  	4
701	不公平瓜分了这世界，除了忧愁分得公平，什么东西都分得不公平。	2
702	他的灵魂对他说：“我们别耽搁了，赶快起身吧，因为海神爱妒嫉，有许多俯首听命的怪兽。” 	3
703	“我的玫瑰是白色的，”玫瑰树回答道，白得像海浪的泡沫，甚至比山头的冰雪还要洁白。	0
704	“这真是一场可笑的恋爱别的燕子都叽叽喳喳地说，“瞧那芦苇不趁钱,亲戚倒有一大群。”这倒是实情，河里到处长满了芦苇。 	0
705	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。 	1
706	As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.	0
707	‘And how do you like the Waterrat?’ asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards.	0
708	“难道我们不都是一家人吗？”商人说， 	4
709	嗖！嗖！转轮焰火一圈又一圈地旋转着。	0
710	“你有什么话捎往埃及吗？”他大声说，“我马上要飞走了。” 	2
711	One always suffers for being generous.'‘	1
712	Nor came the Sea–folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.	1
713	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
714	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
715	Behind him stood a brass–turbaned Nubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split ears.	3
716	他的灵魂苦苦地恳求他，可是他不为所动，只是从一块岩石向另一块岩石跳去,脚步稳得像一只野山羊，最后他下到了地面，眼前就是黄色的海岸。 	1
717	He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and rushing forward struck at me with great violence.	3

723	And the Star–Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	0
724	That is capital,' said the Infanta, after a pause; 'but now you must dance for me.'	0
725	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
726	On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat, and a pair of riding–gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed–pearls wrought into a curious device.	0
727	百合花比精选的珍珠还白净啊，百合花的茎比银子还纏亮。	0
728	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
729	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3

734	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: Wilt thou not close the door?	3
735	And on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, 'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?'	0
736	When they caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the market– place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody. 	3
737	那是一片荒凉的墓地，位于城外。	3
738	雪橇的样子像一只金色大天鹅，这位纤巧的公主本人坐在天鹅的翅膀中间。	0
739	I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his nightcap, but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	1

748	看哪！阳光从彩色窗户照射进来，光束在他身上编织了一件绢袍，比那件为他快乐而编织的皇袍还精美； 	0
749	你就别自找烦恼,别埋怨我，还是不闹为好，因为你不放弃也不会有痛苦,你不接受也不会有欢乐。” 	2
750	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.	1

757	And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.	1
758	有些人以为只要你没完没了念叨同一件事情，它终会如你所说，转轮焰火就是这种人。 	2

767	‘Well, I said Pylotechnic,’ answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
768	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	1
769	我们先是和马加达人打仗，他们生下来就是老人，每活年年轻一岁，等他们成了小孩儿就死去了；接着和拉克特罗伊人打仗，他们说他们是老虎的儿子，把自己涂得黄黑相间;随后是和奥兰特斯人打仗，他们把他们的死者葬在树梢，而他们自己却住在黑洞里,生怕见到太阳，因太阳是他们的神，会把他们杀死；接下来和克里姆尼安人打仗,他们崇拜鳄鱼,用青草慰劳鳄鱼，还喂鳄鱼黄油和活鸡活鸭；再就是和阿加宗巴人打仗，他们长着狗一样的脸；然后是和西邦人打仗，他们长着马一样的蹄子，跑起来比马还快。 	3

774	‘Shall I love you?’ said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.	4

784	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
785	The young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, 'Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold. Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers. And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing that I love?'	1
786	我可是宫廷的大宠儿,实际上，王子和公主昨天就是冲我的面子才举行婚礼的。	0
787	And the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, 'My lord, I pray thee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe, and set this crown upon thy head. 	0

790	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
791	“当然不是，”绿红雀回答说，“这才刚刚开始。” 	0
792	‘He is weeping for a red rose,’ said the Nightingale.	1
793	They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal Nuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had returned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his carriage.	0
794	兔子跟他说，你找的那块红金子就在你身后的那个岩洞里。	4

805	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
806	Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river. 	1
807	At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered on the colour he loved best.	0

809	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
810	The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.	1

827	She shook her head. 	1
828	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶。”	3
829	实际上是王子的铅做的心脏破成两瓣儿了。 	1
830	但是他紧紧地把她抱住不放，不让她逃走。 	4

837	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
838	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
839	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	0
840	为那些坏事你犯得着烦恼吗？ 	1
841	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说，这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
842	But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?	2
843	Pale, sickly–looking children were crouched on the huge crossbeams. 	1

876	但是正在他们互相哀叹他们的痛苦时，一件怪事发生了。 	1
877	The Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could not restrain their feelings any longer. 	2
878	‘Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,’ she murmured.	1
879	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3

881	我没有听他们的，却走过去和兜售古怪神像的贩子坐在一起,他们因为干这一行深遭人痛恨。 	2
882	What a very stupid thing to do'!	2
883	所谓同情就是这么回事。 	4

893	可是我们不能把小汉斯叫到这里来吗？'磨坊主最小的儿子问道，' 	1
894	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
895	房子的一扇窗户开着，我从窗子看见一个女人坐在桌子前面。她的脸又瘦又憔悴，一双手红红的，很粗糙，被针扎得到处是针眼儿，因为她是做针线的女工。	1
896	When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the hand, and placed me by his side.	4

945	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
946	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
947	But what are these things to thee?	2
948	Its voice was low and flute–like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake.	1
949	She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.	2
950	捕鱼的小伙子听了这番苦涩的话，顿时泪水盈眶，他从地上站起来，对神父说:“神父啊，农牧神生活在森林里很快活,人鱼弹着他们的金红色竖琴坐在岩石上。 	1
951	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
952	苍白的月儿听见了，把黎明忘在脑后，滞留在天空不肯离去。	0
953	I stood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.	1
954	有一回，我看见一头大象走过， 	0
955	在士兵周围拥挤的人群之中，他看见了他的母亲，那个要饭女人，她身边站着那个曾坐在路边等他的麻风病人。 	1
956	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
957	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
958	人们肃然起敬，纷纷跪了下来，宫廷大员们赶快把剑收进鞘里，俯首称臣，主教的脸顿时变得惨白，双手抖动不止。	3
959	And when he had laid out the carpet on the floor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.	0
960	‘Why, indeed?’ whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.	0
961	我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
962	And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, 'Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?'	4
963	他的朋友六个星期前都飞往埃及去了，但他耽搁下来，因他和最美丽的芦苇相爱了。	4
964	说真的，每当我想到我举足轻重的身份,我就感动得直掉泪。	1
965	‘Yes, that is just what I want to know,’ said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.	0
966	‘'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; 'very thoughtful indeed.	0
967	After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly–lit room. 	1
968	已经是冬天了，燕子回答说，这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	1
969	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
970	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	2
971	死亡对她说：“你手里拿着什么？” 	3
972	But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the most tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day.	0
973	‘Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.	3
974	她会从国王的御榻上下来，跟你走遍全世界。 	4
975	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。 	3
976	But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.	1
977	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
978	You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.	0
979	So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.	3
980	我终于能在我的花园里干活儿了，真是再快乐不过。'他说完，马上开始去劳作了。 	0
981	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
982	于是他们把快乐王子的塑像拉倒了。	1
983	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, Why art thou weeping?	1
984	这样，在国王花园的一端搭起了一个大架子，皇家焰火匠将一切安排停当后,焰火们马上交谈起来。 	0
985	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
986	我们种下玉米，我们的餐桌上却没有吃的。	1
987	他用柳条抽它，它就呜呜叫着离去了。 	1
988	The wine–sellers elbow their way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders.	0
989	And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.	1
990	不过，这些孩子看见它们的花花点点的膨颈和一伸一缩的芯子，吓得什么似的,倒是更喜欢看见玩儿杂耍的从沙里变出一棵小小的橘子树，让树上开满漂亮的白花,结岀累累果实；后来他拿过拉斯托雷斯侯爵小女儿的扇子，一下子变出一只蓝色的鸟儿，在大帐篷里四处乱飞，叽啾鸣唱,他们见了又高兴又惊奇，简直忘乎所以了。 	0
991	“皇帝把手从脸上拿开，对我说：'这是我的宝屋，其中一半是你的了，我说话是算数的。 	0
992	Dead at his feet it was lying.	1
993	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
994	We toil for them all day long, and they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil. 	1
995	“我干了一件不同寻常的事，不过我所做的也没有什么，我把'富有戒指'藏在一个山洞里，离这里不过一天的路程。 	0
996	It stopped opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed. Thou canst not think how strange a people they are.	0
997	“再快些，再快些！”她叫喊着，而他脚下的大地好像旋转起来，他的头感到难受，一阵巨大的恐惧袭上心头，好像有什么邪恶的东西在盯着他，最后他终于弄清,在一块岩石的影子里有一个人是刚才不在场的。 	3
998	年轻的国王又低下他的头，祈祷，等完成他的祷告，他站了起来，转过身悲哀地看着他们。	1
999	Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him, I answered.	4
1000	他脚上穿着拖鞋,一只是软蛇皮的,另一只是鸟羽毛做的。 	3
1001	他刚刚做了这两件事，巫婆们就像鹰一样尖叫起来，纷纷逃走，而那张一直注视他的苍白的脸立时因痛苦的抽搐变了形。 	3
1002	‘What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?’ he said; ‘I must look for a good chimneypot,’ and he determined to fly away.	1
1003	Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his country, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the New World. 	1
1004	What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.	0
1005	And the sea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.	1
1006	He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.	0
1007	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
1008	这片树林从外面看去非常漂亮，好像到处都是欢唱的鸟儿，到处都是温馨的花朵，星孩满心高兴地走了进去。	0
1009	“我路过庭院时，两个头罩纱巾的女人从阳台上往下看，咒骂我。 	2
1010	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
1011	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
1012	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?	2
1013	可怜的孩子们这下没有地方可玩儿了。	1
1014	王子和公主领衔起舞。	0
1015	她捶打着她那不育的胸脯,大声哭叫起来。	2
1016	真的就像哇哇地叫唤，哇哇叫唤当然是世上最有音乐感的声音了。	0
1017	“他脖子上没有戴着一条琥珀项链吗？ 	1
1018	”他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
1019	All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.	1
1020	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
1021	“亲爱的小燕子，”王子说，“你告诉我许多奇闻轶事，不过受苦受难的男男女女的干万种痛苦，是什么奇闻轶事也比不了的。 	1
1022	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	3
1023	最后他们到达一小海湾，开始测水深。 	3
1024	“哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。 	1
1025	这屋子曾经是所谓“愚蠢的约翰”的卧室，那个发疯的国王对打猎十分迷恋,经常在神智错乱时试图骑上那些扬起前蹄的大马，拖拽那头大猎狗正在攻击的公鹿,吹响他的狩猎号，用他的短剑刺向那只灰白的飞奔的母鹿。 	3
1026	“一位远比我伟大的人为你加冕了啊！”他高声赞叹着，在年轻的国王面前跪了下来。	0
1027	我跟在后面，黑人加快了步子，满脸的不高兴。 	2
1028	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
1029	可是守城的士兵把手里的矛枪往城门口一横,对他粗鲁地说：“你到城里有什么事？”	2
1030	神像额头有一枚珍贵橄榄石，它的胸脯上涂着没药和肉桂。 	0
1031	那个男子走到一个小树林，吹响了口哨。 	0
1032	Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fairhaired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great eldertree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.	1
1033	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
1034	燕子于是啄下来一片又一片赤金，把快乐王子啄得寸金不留,一副灰不溜丢的样子。 	0
1035	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	1
1036	There were huge tortoise–shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies.	0
1037	He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace—Joyeuse, as they called it—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh–fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the council– board or audience–chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from sickness. 	1
1038	Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.	3
1039	他大声招呼着他的同伴，说他找到从天上掉下来的那件宝贝了；他的同伴赶到后，他们坐在雪地里，把斗篷慢慢抖开,好把金子分了。 	0
1040	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任对目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
1041	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
1042	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
1043	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
1044	In every tree that he could see there was a little child.	0
1045	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	2
1046	The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms, he threw it at me.	3
1047	“你愿意和我走吗？”他最后和她说；可是芦苇摇了摇头，她恋家恋得难以割舍啊。 	1
1048	真的，《宫廷报》称赞他是焰火艺术的最好范例呢。	0
1049	最后，他们的眼睛相遇了，而且不管他跳舞旋转到哪里，他都觉得那个人的眼睛在盯着他。 	3
1050	但是我没有在意。 	1
1051	As we passed through the valleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and at night–time we heard the wild men beating on their drums.	3
1052	“事情明摆着，你骨子里没有同情心。”河鼠说。 	2
1053	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	2
1054	You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'	4
1055	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
1056	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
1057	“我的灵魂对我来说什么都不是，”他答道， 	1
1058	告诉我，你能看见我的母亲吗？” 	1
1059	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
1060	神父跟我说灵魂在这世上金不换,商人们却说它连一个银毫子也不值。" 	1
1061	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.	2
1062	“放开我，”她叫喊说,“让我走啊。 	2
1063	For how shall the people know that thou art a king, if thou hast not a king’s raiment?'	3
1064	你的意见太好了，我得先按你说的办，不想银扣子的事了。'他跑去把美丽的迎春花全都拔来，装满了磨坊主的篮子。 	0
1065	在高高的城市上空，一根顶天立地的柱子上站立着快乐王子的塑像。	0
1066	他的灵魂取笑他说：“看来你从你的爱情中得不到多少欢乐嘛。 	1
1067	When they are glad they go to the bird–sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.	1
1068	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
1069	一块是白金，一块是黄金，第三块金子是红色的。 	0
1070	A large press, inlaid with agate and lapis–lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, and a cup of dark–veined onyx. 	0
1071	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，否则你是知道我的身世的。	2
1072	I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.	2
1073	Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. 	0
1074	一等他们把锚抛下，收好帆索，黑人们就到货舱里拿出一架长绳梯，上面拴着沉甸甸的铅块儿。 	3
1075	My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.’	1
1076	So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.	3
1077	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	3
1078	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
1079	A negro brought me some mare’s milk in a wooden dish, and a piece of lamb’s flesh roasted.	0
1080	“这里可不怎么舒服，”他说，不过这里肯定是个时髦的水疗场，他们送我来休养身体的。	1
1081	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
1082	星孩一听这话泪流满面，心下嘀咕道:“他们在嘲笑我，拿我的痛苦寻开心。”	1
1083	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
1084	她躺在他脚边死了。 	1
1085	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	1
1086	可咒的林中农牧神，可咒的海中歌手! 	3
1087	“你说的是实话，”樵夫回答说，“可是我在树林里发现你时对你动了恻隐之心。”	4
1088	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	1
1089	可是，我一点儿也不在乎。 	1
1090	“我要是把心给你了，我用什么来爱我的恋人？”他大声问道。 	1
1091	鞄靶人看到这股红色尘土时，用绳子把彩绘弓捆起来，跳上他们的小矮马，得得得跑着去迎接那股红色尘土。 	0
1092	Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my swordhilt?	4
1093	But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.	0
1094	“'这下可算补好了。'小汉斯回答道，从梯子上走了下来。 	0
1095	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
1096	The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none.	1
1097	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.	2
1098	Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears, and in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales. 	3
1099	‘Give me a red rose,’ she cried, ‘and I will sing you my sweetest song.’	0
1100	Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.'	1
1101	鸟儿们到处飞动，高兴得叽叽喳喳鸣叫，花儿从绿草地往上张望，喜笑颜开。	0
1102	在战争中，织工回答说，强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
1103	‘I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
1104	喂，我说你的迎春花儿长得实在喜人呀！ 	0
1105	“好开心！”他嚷道，我就要这样一直飞上去了。	0
1106	那个国王自己就在那里，躺在他的油漆棺材里。 	1
1107	Get thee gone.	2
1108	“这下有好看的了，”火箭嚷嚷说,“他们要在光天化日下送我上天了，这样谁都可以看见我了。” 	0
1109	“我要去埃及！”燕子大声说，可是没有人在意，月亮升起来时，他又飞回快乐王子身边。 	1
1110	“我笑是因为我高兴呀。”爆竹回答说。	0
1111	“村子的居民看见我们来了，就往井里投毒药，纷纷逃往山顶。 	3
1112	Hans,' said the Miller, 'friendship never forgets.	4
1113	“我有许多美丽的花儿，”他说，“可是孩子们才是所有花中最美丽的花朵啊。”	0
1114	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
1115	于是，燕子啄掉了王子的另一只眼睛,衔着飞走了。	1
1116	Nay,' answered his Soul, 'but she was true to Him she worships, and whose servant she will be ever.'	4
1117	它从天边一路往下落，途中路过了许多别的星星；他们惊奇地看着它下落，他们好像看见它落在离小羊圈不远一簇柳树后面了。 	0
1118	你看，既然我把手推车送给你了，我敢说你准会回报我一些花儿的。 	4
1119	And his Soul said to him, 'Smite that child.' So he smote the child till it wept, and when he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.	1
1120	He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.	1
1121	但是，它们好像并没有发生多大作用。	1
1122	友谊的不同凡响就在这里，不过我担心你理解不了生活的诗情画意。 	1
1123	捕鱼的小伙子顿时脸色煞白，攥紧两手，大叫道：“她是一个假巫婆，她沒有跟我说这话。” 	3
1124	然后他们穿过许多条街道，来到一道小门前，开小门的这面墙被一棵石榴树遮掩着。 	0
1125	He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.	3
1126	窗外，他可以望见大教堂那巨大的圆顶，朦朦胧胧的，宛如从影影绰绰的房屋上面鼓出的气泡，那无精打采的哨兵在河边薄雾笼罩的台地上来回走动。 	1
1127	He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he turned round, and kissed it.	4
1128	务必把那块白金带来,要不你过不了这关，别忘了你是我的奴隶,我可是用一碗甜酒的价钱把你买来的。	3
1129	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	1
1130	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	1
1131	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，“不过这也不出我所料。	2
1132	Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,' said the Soul.	0
1133	The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.	0
1134	She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.	1
1135	I have six beautiful daughters.	0
1136	‘A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,’ answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
1137	“真是奇怪，”他说，“天气虽然这么冷，我现在却觉得身上热乎乎的。” 	0
1138	“听我说，这完全是政府的失误，如果你不相信，那我就把你吃掉。”狼有一副不折不扣的好使的脑子，只要争论起来，他是从来不会输掉的。 	2
1139	Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.	2
1140	No sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain.	1
1141	“'我很对不起，'小汉斯说，揉着眼睛把睡帽揭下来，'可是我累得不行，本以为可以在床上多休息一会儿，听听鸟儿唱歌。你知道吗？我听听鸟儿唱，干活儿总是很带劲儿。' 	0
1142	Their little pink feet were quite frost–bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.	0
1143	他亲吻过快乐王子的嘴唇，掉在王子脚下死去了。	1
1144	I will not give thee anything,' said Avarice, and she hid her hand in the fold of her raiment. 	2
1145	She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.	0
1146	“富人和穷人难道不是兄弟吗？”年轻的国王问。 	4
1147	但是，快乐王子看上去难过极了，小燕子觉得很过意不去。 	1
1148	他还很幼小,没法儿爬上树的枝杈，正围着那棵树转啊转啊，哭得伤心极了。	1
1149	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
1150	因为我不认自己的母亲,把她赶走，傲慢无礼，对她冷酷无情。 	1
1151	So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.	0
1152	‘Then you are quite behind the age,’ said the Waterrat.	2
1153	For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away.	1
1154	星孩回答说：“我在寻找一块藏在这里的黄金，我要是找不到它，我的主人会打我，把我当奴隶使唤的。”	1
1155	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	0
1156	然而贪婪攥紧手，咬紧牙关。	2
1157	“这可是世间最红的玫瑰。 	0
1158	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？”	2
1159	“到了第十四个月，我们到达伊勒尔城。 	0
1160	你必须跳舞。 	3
1161	我碰巧和糙纸做的药筒呆在一个抽屉里，今天早上我听到新娘新郎的所有故事,还听说了宫中的最新消息。“ 	0
1162	“在远处一条小街上，有一所穷人住的房子。 	1
1163	“从前，”绿红雀说，“有一个名叫汉斯的诚实的小家伙。”  	0
1164	Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.'	1
1165	“哦，真的，”一枚流星火花大声应道，“为什么要不高兴呢？这正是找乐子的机会，我飞上蓝天时，还打算把这一切都告诉星星呢。 	0
1166	那是花园最远的角落,一个小男孩儿正站在那里。 	1
1167	 'I will not give thee anything,' she muttered. 	2
1168	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
1169	不过我现在说也不晚。”于是，他扯尖嗓子嚷嚷了一声“呸”，尾巴嗖地甩了一下，钻回他的洞里去了。 	2
1170	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
1171	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney pots down.	2
1172	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
1173	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
1174	The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.	0
1175	那棵可怜的树仍然盖满了霜和雪，北风呼呼地吹，在树梢上呜呜地叫。	1
1176	于是他悄悄走下楼梯，蹑手蹑脚地打开前门，走出房子，进了花园。 	3
1177	他觉得他在一片昏暗的林子里闲荡,上挂满了奇怪的果子和美丽的毒花儿。 	3
1178	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
1179	他立即进了门，把那孩子塞进她的怀里；她亲过孩子，把他放在他们家最小的孩子躺着的小床上。	4
1180	他们大多数人都兜售设拉子葡萄酒，那酒像蜜一样甜。 	0
1181	You will wear it tonight next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	4
1182	He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.	0
1183	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
1184	这是篮子，请你把它装得满满的。' 	0
1185	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
1186	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
1187	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。	3
1188	突然间，一只狗在树林里叫起来，跳舞的人停了下来，双双走了过去，跪下来,亲吻那个人的手。 	4
1189	Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield, and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.	0
1190	In the centre of the grassplot was standing a beautiful Rosetree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.	0
1191	‘When I was alive and had a human heart,’ answered the statue, ‘I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of SansSouci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.	1
1192	可是，她就是不和我跳舞，因为我没红玫瑰献给她，他有气无力地倒在草地上，把脸埋在两只手里,哭了。	1
1193	A whipping master should be sent for,' said Don Pedro wearily, and he went back to the terrace.	1
1194	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
1195	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of white gold?'	0
1196	The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands.	0
1197	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
1198	“我和你再呆一个夜晚吧，”燕子说，真的动了恻隐之心。	4
1199	她老早就被缚在了一个旧松木盒子上,颇为她破碎的心感到自豪,“可是爱这东西不再时髦了，全让诗人扼杀了。	1
1200	你要买点什么？你要买点什么？我可在臼里捣碎一只癞蛤蟆，把它做成汤，用一只死人的手搅动汤。 	3
1201	At the prow of the galley sat a shark–charmer, beating monotonously upon a drum. 	1
1202	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
1203	“你当然难受了！”信号焰火叫道。	1
1204	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cartwheel went over it.	2
1205	‘She was like a white rose before,’ said a young Page to his neighbour, ‘but she is like a red rose now’; and the whole Court was delighted.	0
1206	How happy we are here! they cried to each other.	0
1207	灵魂孤零零地站在海滩上，注视着他们。 	1
1208	你还是跟我走好,我知道'快活谷'在哪里，知道那里盛产什么。” 	0
1209	“‘你这孩子真是蠢材！'磨坊主大叫道，'我真不明白送你上学有什么用处。你看样子什么都没有学会。 	2
1210	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
1211	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
1212	就算它们是真的爆竹，那也不会比这看上去好看。 	0
1213	他把红金子装进他的袋子，急忙朝城里赶去。 	0
1214	那位香客回答说：“看看这面镜子,你会看见他的。“ 	4
1215	他对所有的市民都主持公道，施与慈悲；他把那个邪恶的魔术师驱逐岀去，给那个樵夫和他老伴儿送去许多丰厚的礼物，并且对他们的孩子封官晋爵。	4
1216	爆竹嘣嘣地回应着，快活得无以言表。	0
1217	What is it?	3
1218	我这件皇袍是悲伤的织机织的，是痛苦的苍白的手织的。	1
1219	When the moon is full, when the moon is full,' she muttered.	3
1220	我永远都对付不了这种事。	3
1221	吉卜赛人确实表演得非常成功。 	0
1222	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rosetree, and set her breast against the thorn.	1
1223	因为他的爱情胀满，他的心破碎了，灵魂找到了入口,挤了进去，像过去一样和他成为一体了。 	1
1224	‘Ah! what a trivial view of life!’ said the Rocket; ‘but it is only what I expected.	2
1225	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。” 	4
1226	“可怜的小汉斯正着急到他的花园去干活儿，他的花儿两天都没有浇水了，可他又不愿意拒绝磨坊主，他真是磨坊主一个忠心耿耿的朋友。 	4
1227	How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.	2
1228	So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.'	0
1229	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
1230	今天你去给我把那块白金拿来,要是你拿不来，那我准会让你挨上一百鞭子。	2
1231	“我看春天终于来了。”巨人说，他从床上跳下，往外张望。	0
1232	All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him goodbye.	0
1233	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
1234	‘How shabby indeed!’ cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.	2
1235	“我走近他们时，商人的头儿站起来,抽出腰刀，问我有何公干。 	2
1236	The Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes place every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and in her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to have been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a poisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.	3
1237	Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.	0
1238	I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.	2
1239	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
1240	在新月宴上，年轻的皇帝从宫里岀来,到清真寺里祈祷。 	0
1241	“我们从蹴題人国进入诅咒月亮的人的国家。 	3
1242	For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.	1
1243	他看见星孩来了，赶紧敲响一个木碗，揺起他的铃，向他呼求，说：给我一点儿钱吧，要不我就饿死了。	1
1244	I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out.	0
1245	And when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and whispered, saying: 'Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream, and a vision but a vision? They are not real things that one should heed them. 	2
1246	啧，我看跟宫廷大臣的侄儿根本没法儿相比，你的鞋上可有银襻子？”她从椅子上站起身，走进了住宅。 	2
1247	‘You are the rudest person I ever met,’ said the Rocket, ‘and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.’	2
1248	They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet blossoms. 	2
1249	捕鱼的小伙子一阵颤抖。 	3
1250	“大地就要喜结良缘了，这是她的婚礼服。”斑鸠彼此小声交谈说。	0
1251	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
1252	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
1253	其余的人纷纷私下嘀咕我，说我带给他们坏运气。 	2
1254	When the moon is full I shall be with thee, and we will dance together on the grass.'	0
1255	And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.	0
1256	“我们真得发表一份告示，禁止鸟类死在这里。” 	2
1257	By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,' she made answer.	3
1258	He swooped past the matchgirl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.	0
1259	‘If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.’	0
1260	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	1
1261	How he wished that he had gone back with her!	1
1262	Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court, and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.	0
1263	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	2
1264	只有那个小男孩儿没有跑掉，因为他的眼睛里满是泪水，没有看见巨人走了过来。	1
1265	至于我，我不需要这些东西。 	1
1266	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
1267	那妖怪也把白玫瑰撕成了碎片，把残碎的花瓣儿抛向了空中。 	1
1268	Who is thy master?' asked the young King. 	3
1269	“什么秘密？”巫婆问道，像一只野猫一样跟他较劲，紧紧咬着沾满白沫的嘴唇。 	2
1270	“一点不错，”樵夫回答说，“正像你说的一样。” 	0
1271	这下我能写完我的剧本了，他看上去相当幸福。	0
1272	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	0
1273	你就快快离开这里吧，别再让我看见你这张难看的脸。	2
1274	For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain, has this my robe been woven. 	1
1275	We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.	0
1276	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	4
1277	And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	0
1278	三天过去，婚礼正式举行。 	0
1279	“看看他那罗锅背，看看他那罗圈儿腿，”他们开始格儿格儿笑起来。 	0
1280	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	2
1281	No one ever saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon–flies. 	0
1282	After that they had done this several times, they disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear by a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little Barbary apes. 	0
1283	Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.’	1
1284	于是燕子在城市上空飞翔，看见富人在他们美丽的宅邸寻欢作乐，而乞丐坐在大门前行乞。 	1
1285	可是夜莺明白这位大学生的苦衷，呆在栎树丛里一声不吭，默想着爱情的秘密所在。	1
1286	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
1287	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
1288	As we approached it two eunuchs came out to meet us.	0
1289	雪往草地盖上了她那巨大的白色斗篷，霜把所有的树都涂上了银色。	0
1290	孩子们组成一个圈子，扇着手中的大扇子，彼此低声交谈，唐•彼德罗和大法庭庭长站在圈子入口处笑容满面。 	0
1291	Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, but I am really very busy today.	1
1292	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.	3
1293	And the Hare answered him, and said: 'Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?'	4
1294	咸涩的浪花在桨叶中翻飞。	1
1295	Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	0
1296	From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them. 	1
1297	In fact, it is essentially suburban.	1
1298	“我问那僧侣说：'这就是那个神吗？' 	2
1299	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
1300	但是捕鱼的小伙子回答说：“要我放你走也不难，只要你答应我，不管多会儿我呼喊你，你都要来给我唱歌，因为鱼儿都喜欢听海民唱歌，这样我可以把我的网子捞满了。” 	0
1301	Thou art not one of us. 	2
1302	人们按他吩咐的去做，把他们埋在那没有香甜的草木生长、冷僻的漂洗工坟地里，人们把土坑挖得很深，把两具尸体埋了进去。 	1
1303	御榻旁的一张桌子上，放着一把锋利的短弯刀。 	3
1304	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	0
1305	但是贪婪摇了摇头。 	1
1306	‘You are a very irritating person,’ said the Rocket, ‘and very illbred.	2
1307	In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.	0
1308	每天下午，孩子们从学校出来后，都往往到巨人的花园去玩耍。	0
1309	There be some who lack raiment, and others who lack bread.	1
1310	神父拍了拍他的胸膛，回答说：“呜呼，呜呼，你疯了，要不就是吃了什么有毒的药灵魂是人类最咼贵的部分，是上帝赐予我们的，我们应该极好地使用它。 	4
1311	但是他对老婆说：“我在树林里拾到一样东西，就给你带来了，让你照管他站在门边没有进来。 	0
1312	Some of the boys pranced about on richly–caparisoned hobby–horses brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull, and vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for the bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made of wicker–work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of doing.	0
1313	但是孩子们尖声尖气的笑声在他耳边萦绕，明朗而无情的阳光嘲弄着他的悲哀，连早晨清新的空气也混入了一种单调的怪味道，闻起来就像涂抹防腐香料的人使用的那种这是不是一种幻觉？他把脸埋进他的两手， 	1
1314	“你的声音可真好听！”青蛙大声说。	0
1315	骆驼看见它们时都在发抖。 	3
1316	 And he told him his three dreams. 	3
1317	这男人一时无话，但仍站在门前不动弹。 	3
1318	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	1
1319	然而，他的灵魂没有离开他，也没有听他的话，只是跟他说：“那巫婆告诉你的那招不灵了，我不离开你，你也别想赶走我。 	4
1320	And after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman grew wroth, and said to his Soul, 'Why didst thou tell me to smite the child, for it was an evil thing to do?'	2
1321	他想了一会儿，把屋子别的地方全看遍了。 	1
1322	这是我的一大乐趣。	0
1323	And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.’	1
1324	But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.	1
1325	At last, however, after a prolonged combat, during which several of the hobby–horses were gored through and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of Tierra–Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained permission from the Infanta to give the coup de grace, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head came right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de Lorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.	0
1326	“一尊大塑像连一点雨都遮挡不了，它还有什么用？”他发问说，“我只好去找一个好烟囱去躲躲了。”他决定飞走算了。	2
1327	我就这样生活了一辈子，又这样死去了。 	1
1328	所以你别哭了。高兴起来吧。” 	0
1329	“真的就像哇哇地叫唤，哇哇叫唤当然是世上最有音乐感的声音了。 	0
1330	他一回来就看见孩子们在花园里玩耍。	0
1331	Could the shadows of things have colour and life and movement?	3
1332	我可以问一声，你生来就这副样子，还是一场事故造成的？” 	2
1333	And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.	2
1334	Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
1335	那神像是用乌木雕刻成的，雕像是人的样子。 	3
1336	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
1337	A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.	0
1338	It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water.	3
1339	‘My own garden is my own garden,’ said the Giant; ‘any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.’	2
1340	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
1341	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
1342	He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find her others.	0
1343	但是风向岸边吹时，鱼儿就从海底游来，纷纷钻进他的网眼，他捕上鱼儿送到市场，把它们卖掉。 	0
1344	‘Ah! but we have, in our dreams,’ answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.	2
1345	所以我一定要离开这里，走遍全世界也要找到她，直到得到她的原谅。” 	1
1346	‘Thank you, little Swallow,’ said the Prince.	4
1347	And the people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and said to his Soul, 'Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is not here.'	3
1348	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
1349	Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?	3
1350	高兴起来吧。	0
1351	In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.	2
1352	‘Nay,’ I answered, ‘but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I know what is written within it, and for what purpose.’	3
1353	这世界的负重是任何一个人都承担不了的，这世界的悲哀也是任何一颗心都承受不了的啊。	1
1354	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
1355	“胡扯！”狼嗥嗥叫道。	2
1356	听你谈论友谊是一种享受。我敢说连那个教士都说不出你这样中听的话，别看他住在一幢三层楼大住宅里，小拇指上还戴着一个金戒指。 	0
1357	“我活着时，曾有一颗常人的心。塑像回答说，我那时不知道泪水是什么，因为我生在逍遥宫里，忧愁是没法进那里的。	1
1358	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
1359	它们向太阳开屏时那尾巴就像象牙碟子，就像镀金碟子。 	0
1360	他勒住缰绳，说：“不，我就是国王。” 	0
1361	但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。	0
1362	Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night. 	1
1363	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
1364	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
1365	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
1366	‘I am laughing because I am happy,’ replied the Cracker.	0
1367	炉膛没有火，他饿得有气无力。	1
1368	哎呀呀，瞧瞧我就要把我的手推车送给你了，我以为你会更卖力地干活儿呢。万恶懒为首啊，我当然不喜欢我的任何朋友无所事事，一副懒洋洋的样子。 	2
1369	快快滚到一边。	2
1370	“'今天的活儿可真累得够呛，'小汉斯一边上床睡觉一边心下琢磨，'不过好在我没有拒绝磨坊主，他毕竟是我最好的朋友，况且他还要送我他的手推车呢。' 	0
1371	“秩序！秩序！”一个爆竹吆喝道。	2
1372	这天也确实是一个名副其实的好日子。 	0
1373	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	0
1374	卖酒小贩在人群中拥挤而行，肩部的皮肤全都黝黑黝黑的。 	1
1375	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
1376	他试图一直把手伸下去，但是某种又光又硬的东西阻止了他。 	3
1377	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	4
1378	那头儿微微一笑，让我看了看五颗撼在长竹竿上的人头。 	3
1379	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，“这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
1380	他确实备受仰慕。	4
1381	他一时忘了自己的忧愁，返身跑到那儿，看见一只小兔子掉进了猎人设下的陷阱。	1
1382	‘Well, that is his loss, not mine,’ answered the Rocket.	2
1383	The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business.	3
1384	请你给我爰吧。	4
1385	“多么不听话的孩子啊！”老河鼠嚷道，“他们只配在水里淹死。”  	2
1386	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me tonight, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
1387	他身后继位的人却以恶治国。	2
1388	But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before, and the Giant felt very sad.	1
1389	Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.	0
1390	Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me wherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.'	2
1391	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
1392	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？	2
1393	Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart.	1
1394	And he grew pale, and said: 'For what king?'	3
1395	It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow–trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s–throw away.	0
1396	你没有眼睛什么都看不见啊。	1
1397	How lucky you mentioned it!	0
1398	年轻的国王端详着这些东西，发现它们很美丽。	0
1399	“我自己的花园就是我自己的花园，”巨人说，“谁都明白这个理儿，我以后不让任何人来玩儿，我自己想怎么玩儿都行。” 	2
1400	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rosetree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	0
1401	He should have been mine,' she muttered, 'I am as fair as she is.'	2
1402	“快去叫一个掌鞭高手来。”唐•彼德罗不耐烦地说，走回到平台上。 	2
1403	The Infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of siesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra–Nueva for his charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children following in the same order in which they had entered.	0
1404	But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her, and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.	1
1405	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:“我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
1406	”“是啊，”所有的孩子们都附和说,你一定要站起来跳舞啊，你看你像北非小猿猴一样鬼精，可比它们要可笑得多呢。 	2
1407	But the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and fainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.	1
1408	“我不明白为什么春天这么晚了还不来，”自私的巨人心下思忖，坐在窗前看着他那冰天雪地的花园，“但愿这气候变化变化才好。”	1
1409	星孩回答他们说：我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
1410	Behind him stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his confessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side. 	2
1411	星孩拿上那块黄金，把黄金装进了袋子，急匆匆往城里赶去。 	3
1412	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
1413	How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
1414	For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,' she cried, and she ran out into the garden.	2
1415	The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.	0
1416	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
1417	I will not give thee anything,' said Avarice. 	2
1418	“你好冷酷啊。 	2
1419	在他身旁的草地上放着一顶羽饰的帽子，一双镶嵌花边的骑马戴的长腕手套，上面用珍珠缀岀一种奇特的图案。 	0
1420	他跑进家门，既惊奇又惊喜。 	0
1421	Again and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with him a beautiful pearl. 	0
1422	In a few moments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge–shaped heads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water.	0
1423	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
1424	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
1425	它就像那月儿，天长地久。 	0
1426	乃但是他回答同伴说：“不，这斗篷既不是我的，也不是你的，是这孩子的他和同伴告别，走到自家门口，敲响了门。 	1
1427	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
1428	It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,' she cried, and she clung to his knees weeping.	1
1429	他飞过卖火柴的小女孩儿身旁，他把蓝宝石放在了她的手掌上。	0
1430	But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, 'If thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.'	2
1431	于是，他轻手轻脚地抱起那孩子，用斗篷把孩子包裹上，免得孩子受冻，然后寻路下山，向村子走去；他的同伴对他的愚蠢行为和好心肠感到很不理解。	4
1432	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	0
1433	And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, 'Why dost thou call to me?'	2
1434	他对着尸体忏悔。 	1
1435	她做了一个表示失望的小怪相，并耸了耸双肩。 	1
1436	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
1437	“没错儿，”信号焰火大声呼应说,他这时的情绪好了些，“这可是个常识问题。” 	0
1438	第二天，燕子飞到了海港。 	0
1439	“你挑选对了，”上帝说，“因为在我的乐园里，这只小鸟会永远唱下去，而在我的金子城市里，快乐王子会赞美我的。”	0
1440	‘It is going to rain sticks’; and she rushed into the water.	3
1441	一天，巨人回来了。 	3
1442	At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at sunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.	0
1443	“这里好冷啊，”他说，“不过我会跟你呆上一个夜晚，给你当送信的人。”	4
1444	“那天天气热得要命，路上到处是尘土，好不容易走到第六块里程碑，就累得坐在地上歇口气儿。 	1
1445	It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.'	1
1446	然后他轻轻地绕着床飞,用翅膀往小男孩儿的脑门儿上扇风。	0
1447	谁知道小东西会不会给咱家带来坏运气？	3
1448	年轻的国王走向一个织工，站在他身边打量他。 	0
1449	她最初唱的是爱情在少男和少女的心扉萌生。	0
1450	From the palace of the Sea–King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.	1
1451	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
1452	You must dance. The Infanta of Spain and the Indies wishes to be amused.'	3
1453	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
1454	We tread out the grapes, and another drinks the wine. 	1
1455	嗨，就是夜莺自己也不怎么好看呀，尽管她深夜在橘林里把歌儿唱得那么动听，有时连月亮都忍不住探下身子听几段；再说啦，他对鸟儿们一直很好：在那可怕的寒冷的冬天，树上全都没有了果实，地上冻得跟铁一样硬，狼群纷纷到城市大门口寻找食物，小矮人从来没有把他们忘记了，总是从他那少得可怜的黑面包里分出些碎渣渣给他们吃，而且只要他有一顿穷兮兮的早餐，也总是分给他们一些。 	4
1456	“这是真的吗？”他嘟嚷说。 	1
1457	除了非凡的火箭，每一个都表演得非常成功。	0
1458	很遗憾，因为他长得奇丑无比，他才博得国王一笑。” 	1
1459	Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.	0
1460	‘I have a golden bedroom,’ he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.	1
1461	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
1462	An African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered with a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he took from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it.	0
1463	他飞过了宫殿上空，听见了舞会的声音。 	0
1464	每天下午，学校放学后孩子们都要来和巨人玩耍。	0
1465	它们不是世人应该在意的真东西。 	1
1466	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
1467	There is Blood in the heart of the ruby, and Death in the heart of the pearl. 	3
1468	然后是盛大的国宴，持续了五个小时。	0
1469	“他们是我的仆人。”她回答说。 	4
1470	这就是他的求婚活动，整整持续了一个夏天。 	0
1471	她们边跳边笑，那笑声像泉水丁冬一样欢快清澈。 	0
1472	My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.	0
1473	为了她的玉体，我放弃我的灵魂，为了她的爱，我放弃天堂。 	4
1474	“我们现在有面包吃了！”他们欢呼说。	0
1475	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。	3
1476	Once every month the King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand, went in and knelt by her side calling out, 'Mi reina! Mi reina!' and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs every separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a King, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.	1
1477	My roses are red, it answered, as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the oceancavern.	0
1478	樵夫这时在附近一个木料场里砍木头，看见了星孩的所作所为，就跑过来训斥他说：“你真是铁石心肠，一点不知可怜人，这个可怜的女人究竟干了什么坏事惹了你，你这样对待他？”	2
1479	Truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'it was even as thou sayest.'	0
1480	树间到处是猿和孔雀。	0
1481	There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry, and a brass–sealed ceiling hung with lamps.	0
1482	谁是你的老板？〃年轻的国王问道。 	2
1483	唯一欢迎这大冷天的好像只有大角猫头鹰。	0
1484	大长鼻子上涂着银朱砂和郁金,耳朵上罩着红丝绳织的网。 	0
1485	Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?'	3
1486	The master of the galley weighed them, and put them into a little bag of green leather. 	0
1487	“我看不见它。 	1
1488	You seem not to learn anything.	2
1489	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
1490	And he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream. 	0
1491	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.	2
1492	你能阻止这些事情发生吗？你愿意和麻风病人同床共寝吗？愿意和乞丐同桌共餐吗？狮子会按你说的做吗？野猪会听从你的命令吗？造成人间苦难的他不比你更精明吗？ 	2
1493	The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper.	0
1494	She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.	0
1495	国王说：“这就是你的母亲，你用泪水清洗了她的脚。”	4
1496	As she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again. 	0
1497	“在远处，”塑像接着低声软语地说， 	1
1498	Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy our King over us.'	0
1499	但是，女礼仪官插话说太阳太毒了，认定公主殿下最好赶快回宫，一顿美宴已经为她准备下了，其中有一个真正的生日蛋糕，她名字的略写字母用彩糖涂在了上面，一面可爰的小银旗在上面飘动。 	0
1500	So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.	0
1501	Be happy, cried the Nightingale, be happy, you shall have your red rose.	0
1502	说实话，痛苦才是这世界的主宰，谁都逃不过它的网。 	1
1503	But I am going to buy them all back again now.'	0
1504	It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.	0
1505	她唱的歌儿十分动听悦耳。 	0
1506	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
1507	每一棵树上他都看见有一个小孩儿。 	1
1508	“可是人家并没有失去他们唯一的儿子,”焰火筒说，“他们根本就没遇上倒霉的事。”	0
1509	“等月儿圆时，等月儿圆时。”她嘟哝说。 	1
1510	“你们怎么知道的？”刻板的校长发问道，“你们又从来没见过天使什么样 子。 	2
1511	He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.	4
1512	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
1513	现在我一门心思在家务上，照顾好我的家庭。” 	4
1514	星孩一看她走了，心下欢喜，赶紧去找他可以一起玩耍的小伙伴去了。	0
1515	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.	0
1516	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她司:星孩问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？” 	2
1517	我想不会的。 	1
1518	“瞰！那我就不清楚了，”绿红雀回答说，“我也根本不关心那个。” 	2
1519	When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.	0
1520	A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.	1
1521	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
1522	但是那个巨人深爱的小男孩儿再也没有露面。	1
1523	商人有钱得不到它，金子的分量和它不可同日而语。” 	1
1524	“我愿意再和你呆一个夜晚，”燕子说，可是我不忍心啄掉你的眼睛。	1
1525	河马冲着我们发怒，千方百计袭击我们。 	3
1526	那个孩子渴坏了，可他的母亲干着急没办法啊。	1
1527	And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, 'My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?'	0
1528	Trouble not thyself, but come with me to another city.	3
1529	但是他们信任好心的圣马丁，他对所有的行人都悉心看护，因此他们认着别人的脚印往回走，走得精疲力竭，终于走到了森林的外围，看见在他们脚下的山谷远处，他们居住的村子灯光闪烁。 	0
1530	Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?' he asked.	1
1531	但是，天哪！斗篷里面没有金子，也没有银子，当然也没有什么宝贝，只有一个小孩儿睡在里面。 	1
1532	When we came to the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us.	3
1533	They had seen him often in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the hollow of some old oak–tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels. 	0
1534	海豚围着她转呀转，野海鸥在她头上盘旋。 	0
1535	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	1
1536	‘I am afraid it will not go with my dress,’ she answered; ‘and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.’	0
1537	And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.	0
1538	The Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at the behaviour of the birds. 	2
1539	 And he told them his three dreams. 	1
1540	而你开的价是没有问题的，这只是小事一件啊。” 	4
1541	There was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below.	1
1542	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。 	4
1543	你一定不要在意我跟你说话心直口快。 	4
1544	“他的高论实在不少，不过我这个人呀，总是一副慈母心肠，一看到一个不可救药的光棍儿,眼泪就忍不住要往下淌。” 	1
1545	她的眼睛用歸着了色，她的鼻孔弄得像燕子的翅膀。 	3
1546	然后，他戴上帽子，手里拿着这朵玫瑰花儿，向教授的住宅跑去。 	0
1547	“是我自己的。”每一个市议员都说，他们就吵了起来。 	2
1548	And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candle–bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.	0
1549	栖息在这绿色的林子里,看着太阳乘坐他的金马军，看着月亮乘坐她的银马车，真是一件开心的事啊。	0
1550	但是他皱着眉把她推开，对她说:“如果你不信守你向我发下的誓言，我就把你当假巫婆杀死。” 	2
1551	小矮人皱起眉头，那妖怪也皱起眉头。 	2
1552	蜥蜴也对他喜欢得不得了；每当他跑得累了，躺在草丛里休息，他们就在他身上爬来爬去地尽兴玩耍，竭尽全力赢得他的欢心。 	0
1553	Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.	0
1554	他们的羽毛让白霜冻得硬刷刷,但是他们一点儿也不在乎;他们滚动着他们的大黄眼睛，在森林里彼此遥相呼叫：“啯啯啯喵啯啯!啯啯啯喵啯啯！我们遇到了多么好的天气啊！”	0
1555	Suddenly, with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro’s hand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet and whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and chaunting some wild love–song in their strange guttural language. 	3
1556	But the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them down, and trampled on them.	2
1557	And he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad.	0
1558	‘Far away,’ continued the statue in a low musical voice, ‘far away in a little street there is a poor house.	1
1559	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
1560	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
1561	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us, and they drave him out of the garden.	2
1562	Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?	0
1563	一颗非常明亮而美丽的星星从天上掉下来了。	0
1564	They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
1565	“我怎么感谢你好呢？”星孩说，“瞧瞧吧！你可是第二次救了我啊。”	4
1566	“这也没有什么，”鸭妈妈说，“万事开头难啊，做父母的就得有耐心。” 	4
1567	嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他径直飞向了天。	0
1568	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
1569	There is a way, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
1570	他们俩有一个比同伴跑得快，抢先从柳树中穿过去，从另一边跑岀来，瞧！白雪里真的有一样金玩意儿。 	0
1571	Well, goodbye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.	0
1572	“你有啥权利高兴？ 	2
1573	燕子很容易就进去了。 	0
1574	There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a bronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains.	3
1575	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
1576	当然,我们之间是有区别的他穿金戴银而我衣衫褴褛，我饿得要死而他撑得难受。	1
1577	这乐曲在他耳际萦绕，妙不可言，他原以为一定是国王的乐师演奏着曲子走过。	0
1578	Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.	3
1579	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？	4
1580	那些愚蠢的国事有什么了不起? 	2
1581	‘For a red rose?’ they cried; ‘how very ridiculous!’ and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	2
1582	“不”，死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
1583	我们走到过道的中央，皇帝说了一个难以出口的词儿，一道花岗岩门弹回到一个暗簧上，他用手掩住脸，害怕晃了眼睛。 	3
1584	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
1585	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	4
1586	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
1587	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
1588	He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.	0
1589	她没有穿鞋，没有穿袜子，还光着小脑袋。	1
1590	“总得有听着的人呀，”青蛙回答说，我这人就喜欢一个劲儿说个没完。	0
1591	Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.	0
1592	And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him.	0
1593	你一脸幸福哪。	0
1594	It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.	0
1595	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
1596	比如说,假如今天夜里我有个三长两短，这对谁来说都是一大不幸！	1
1597	可是玫瑰树还是揺头。 	1
1598	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。	1
1599	他走过时蛭蛇冲他嘶嘶直叫，鲜亮的鹦鹉叽叽喳喳在枝头飞来飞去。 	3
1600	Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass. Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl. Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea–shells were her ears, and her lips were like sea–coral. The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.	1
1601	黑色的海越逼越近，白色的浪沫像麻风病人一样呻吟。 	3
1602	我很高兴我旅行过。	0
1603	他倚靠在一张堆满纸的桌子旁,他身边的一只杯子里插着一束枯萎的紫罗兰。 	1
1604	Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.	0
1605	“那么，请问，你认为忠诚的朋友有哪些责任呢？”附近柳树上的一只绿红雀听见了这场谈话，问道。 	4
1606	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	2
1607	It was certainly a magnificent display.	0
1608	“我从来没有说过我认识他呀，”火箭回答说， 	1
1609	And the merchant said to him, 'Why dost thou sit in the market–place, seeing that the booths are closed and the bales corded?'	3
1610	And so large was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a palace of a King.	0
1611	And who giveth us food?'	3
1612	‘What are fireworks like?’ she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.	0
1613	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
1614	‘Nay!’ answered the child; ‘but these are the wounds of Love.’	4
1615	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
1616	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
1617	“我们的老板！”织工恶狠狠地大声说。	2
1618	“春天把这花园遗忘了，”他们大叫着，“这下我们可以一年到头住在这里了。”	0
1619	Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.	1
1620	然而等他来到树林外围，他听见灌木丛里传来一声痛苦的尖叫。	1
1621	I am laughing because I am happy, replied the Cracker.	0
1622	快把你的一半财宝送给我，我会走的。' 	3
1623	In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.	0
1624	大小报纸纷纷极尽溢美之词，赞扬他表演得淋漓尽致。 	0
1625	他的灵魂对他说：“抽那个孩子。” 	3
1626	‘'Goodbye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
1627	你的画像很美丽，他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。	0
1628	Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar–woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.	1
1629	And after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, 'What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?'	2
1630	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。	2
1631	‘Show me the god,’ I cried, ‘or I will surely slay thee.’	3
1632	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
1633	It matters not,' she answered. 	1
1634	我不希望争论,青蛙扬扬得意地说。	0
1635	The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rosedance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.	0
1636	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
