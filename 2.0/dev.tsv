147	For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin?	3
148	It is but a day’s journey from this place, and it waits for thy coming.	0
149	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.	0

172	努比亚人像一条遭受践踏的蛇一样乱滚乱跳，嘴唇里扑扑冒着红色血沫。 	3
173	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	4
174	He was really very sorry for what he had done.	1

178	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
179	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
180	多么可怕的灾难！	3
181	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
182	As we passed over the mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.	3
183	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
184	‘And what would you do in return?’ said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	0
185	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3

197	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜悯之情。	4
198	I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'	0
199	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
200	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
201	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	0
202	西班牙公主只有十二岁，太阳把宫殿花园照得一片灿烂。 	0
