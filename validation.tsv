241	This it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.	1
242	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
243	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	2
244	Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield, and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.	0
245	这时樵夫的小女儿走到他身边，把手搭在他肩上，说，即使你真的失去了你的美貌，那又有什么关系呢？	4
246	‘And how do you like the Waterrat?’ asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards.	0
247	他想看到她一个人呆在哪里,告诉她他心心念念爱着她。 	4
248	‘How happy we were there,’ they said to each other.	1
249	然后，他戴上帽子，手里拿着这朵玫瑰花儿，向教授的住宅跑去。 	0
250	一天早上，巨人醒来躺在床上，这时他听见了一种美妙的乐曲。	0
251	Thy face is too happy. 	0
252	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，她就会和我一直跳到天亮。	0
253	然而，圣栎树听明白了，觉得好难过,因他很喜欢这只在他的枝杈上筑窝的小夜莺。	1
254	他看见星孩来了，赶紧敲响一个木碗，揺起他的铃，向他呼求，说：给我一点儿钱吧，要不我就饿死了。	1
255	And he certainly did explode.	0
256	There were opals and sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade.	0
257	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
258	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
259	现在我一门心思在家务上，照顾好我的家庭。” 	4
260	The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.	0
261	‘Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.	3
262	Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart.	1
263	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
264	“你有什么要求？”巫婆发问，走到了他跟前。 	4
265	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
266	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
267	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
268	捕鱼的小伙子笑起来。 	0
269	I would send my soul away from me,' answered the young Fisherman.	1
270	快快滚到一边。	2
271	Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, I am in great trouble.	1
272	御榻旁的一张桌子上，放着一把锋利的短弯刀。 	3
273	我们走到过道的中央，皇帝说了一个难以出口的词儿，一道花岗岩门弹回到一个暗簧上，他用手掩住脸，害怕晃了眼睛。 	3
274	他走过时蛭蛇冲他嘶嘶直叫，鲜亮的鹦鹉叽叽喳喳在枝头飞来飞去。 	3
275	Who is there who careth for us?	2
276	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，否则你是知道我的身世的。	2
277	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
278	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
279	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说，他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
280	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant, tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.	2
281	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
282	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
283	‘It is going to rain sticks’; and she rushed into the water.	3
284	But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little Mermaid and said, 'Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.	4
285	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
286	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
287	They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.	0
288	那位香客回答说：“看看这面镜子,你会看见他的。“ 	4
289	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	0
290	她哗啦哗啦摇着大扇子，拍了几下。 	0
291	“你没有对我做什么坏事，可是我不需要你了。” 	1
292	但是，花儿们对他们的举止烦透了,对鸟儿们的举止也烦透了。 	2
293	“给我一粒吧，”死亡说，“我把它种在花园里；只要一颗，我马上就走。” 	3
294	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	2
295	“富人和穷人难道不是兄弟吗？”年轻的国王问。 	4
296	它像浪花一样白，像一呆花儿一样在上面随浪逐波。 	0
297	他的灵魂苦苦地恳求他，可是他不为所动，只是从一块岩石向另一块岩石跳去,脚步稳得像一只野山羊，最后他下到了地面，眼前就是黄色的海岸。 	1
298	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
299	‘A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,’ answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
300	And the young Fisherman said to himself: 'How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.' And he passed out of the market–place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.	1
301	“这是一个令人愉快的地方，”北风说，“我们一定要请冰雹来访冋。”	0
302	一点不假，他有时会怀念起他在森林中无拘无束的生活，会又寸每天占去许多时间的宫廷繁礼缠节动辄大发脾气，但这令人入迷的宫殿如人称所谓的“欢乐宫”似乎是他寻欢觅乐的全新世界,他发现自己成了宫中的君王。但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。 	0
303	But nobody saw him.	1
304	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?	3
305	栖息在这绿色的林子里,看着太阳乘坐他的金马军，看着月亮乘坐她的银马车，真是一件开心的事啊。	0
306	阿富汗人把那头黑公牛杀死了,正往战场开赴。 	1
307	她比晨星还漂亮，比月亮还洁白。 	0
308	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
309	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
310	吉卜赛人确实表演得非常成功。 	0
311	我回答说我是伊斯兰教托钵僧，赶往麦加城去朝圣，那里有一条绿纱巾，天使们用双手把《古兰经》全都绣在上面了，每个字都银光闪闪的。 	0
312	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
313	小松鼠在杉树上过着孤单的生活，他对小松鼠说：“我的母亲在哪里呢？”	1
314	河马冲着我们发怒，千方百计袭击我们。 	3
315	“那僧侣向我求救，说：'大人您快把奴仆的眼睛治好吧，我会把神指给你看的。' 	4
316	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
317	I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.	0
318	But the young Fisherman laughed.	0
319	“‘你这孩子真是蠢材！'磨坊主大叫道，'我真不明白送你上学有什么用处。你看样子什么都没有学会。 	2
320	”这块土地是自由的，”年轻的国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”	0
321	‘Ahem! ahem!’ he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, ‘Romance is dead.’	1
322	It's quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, "as clear as crystal!" and the King doubled his salary a second time.	0
323	他的船装满鱼时，美人鱼就沉到水下，朝他微笑。 	0
324	一抹淡淡的茉莉花香从敞开的窗子飘了进来。	0
325	‘Dear me!’ said the little Squib, ‘I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour.’	2
326	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
