1	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	0
2	“我要是把心给你了，我用什么来爱我的恋人？”他大声问道。 	1
3	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
4	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
5	这屋子曾经是所谓“愚蠢的约翰”的卧室，那个发疯的国王对打猎十分迷恋,经常在神智错乱时试图骑上那些扬起前蹄的大马，拖拽那头大猎狗正在攻击的公鹿,吹响他的狩猎号，用他的短剑刺向那只灰白的飞奔的母鹿。 	3
6	你肚子里什么都没有，整个儿一个草包。 	1
7	那个老日唇仪嘛，可是一个极其岀名的人物，他曾经亲自向查理五世皇帝一类的大人物报过时间呢，可他一见小矮人的样子，着实吃了一惊，差点儿忘了用他那根长长的带阴影的手指头指岀整整两分钟的时间，他忍不住对在栏杆上晒太阳的乳白色大孔雀说，是人就明白，国王的孩子还是国王，烧炭翁的孩子还是烧炭的，要阻止这种事情发生除非日头从西边出来;孔雀听了这番高论表示完全同意，忍不住尖声叫道：“当然，当然那沙哑的嗓门儿高声大调，竟惊动了在凉水哗哗喷涌的池子里住着的金鱼，他们把头探出水面,向那些石头大海神打听到底发生了什么事情。 	3
8	One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.	1
9	连公爵夫人人们称她为“管家市长”这位围着黄绉领的铁面瘦女人都不像平常那样气势汹汹的，皱巴巴的脸上掠过几丝冷笑,两片没有血色的薄嘴唇咧了咧。 	3
10	冬天的日子他过得也形单影只，因为磨坊主从来不来看望他。  	1
11	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
12	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
13	“我是来和你告别的。”他大声说。	1
14	Dead at his feet it was lying.	1
15	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
16	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
17	Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. 	0
18	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。” 	4
19	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	4
20	他走进了房间，躺在他的小地铺上，开始思念他的情人儿；过了一会儿，他睡着了。 	1
21	那确实是一幕让人惊喜的景色。	0
22	但是那刺儿还没有戳到她的心,所以玫瑰的心还是白的，偏偏只有但写的心血才能将玫瑰的心染红了。 	1
23	He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.	3
24	But the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.	1
25	在一块用小珍珠绣着狮子和卡斯提尔塔楼的大金色华盖下，安放着御座，上面盖了一块遍布银郁金香、巧饰着银子和珍珠坠子的黑天鹅绒布罩。 	0
26	Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court, and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.	0
27	‘'Good morning,' said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear.	0
28	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
29	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
30	“后来呢？”河鼠等了好一会儿，问道。 	1
31	他试图一直把手伸下去，但是某种又光又硬的东西阻止了他。 	3
32	“她像一朵白玫瑰！”他们呼叫着，纷纷从阳台上往她身上抛花儿。	0
33	巨人悄悄地站在他身后，轻轻地把他拿在手里，放在了树上。	4
34	‘It is not comfortable here,’ he remarked, ‘but no doubt it is some fashionable wateringplace, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
35	But I am going to buy them all back again now.'	0
36	“我的玫瑰是红色的，”玫瑰树回答说，红得像鸽子的爪子，甚至比海洋深洞里的珊瑚大扇叶还要红。	0
37	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
38	But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more.	1
39	Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peachtrees that in the spring time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. 	0
40	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
41	In the centre of the grassplot was standing a beautiful Rosetree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.	0
42	At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.	1
43	三天过去，婚礼正式举行。 	0
44	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
45	I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.	2
46	And when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and whispered, saying: 'Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream, and a vision but a vision? They are not real things that one should heed them. 	2
47	Therefore come with me, for I have a guest–chamber.'	0
48	The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a gerfalcon perched upon his wrist.	0
49	原来自己是个罗锅，奇形怪状，惨不忍睹呀！ 	1
50	How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
51	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
52	The Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could not restrain their feelings any longer. 	2
53	老头儿从缠头布上取下一块花绸布，蒙在星孩的眼睛上，推操着往前面走。	3
54	我们从树上摘了熟石榴，掰开它们喝它们的甜汁儿。 	0
55	回声能弄出一个活像这真世界的世界吗？ 	0
56	We toil for them all day long, and they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil. 	1
57	‘Well, I said Pylotechnic,’ answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
58	So they put their noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.	0
59	他往镜子里一看，见是他自己的脸,不禁大叫一声醒了过来，耀眼的阳光照进了屋子，花园和游乐园的树上传来鸟儿的鸣叫。	0
60	然而星孩呆在原地一动不动，对她完全关上了心扉，除了那女人痛苦的哭泣声外，别的什么也没听到。	1
61	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: Wilt thou not close the door?	3
62	星孩一看她走了，心下欢喜，赶紧去找他可以一起玩耍的小伙伴去了。	0
63	许多年过去了,巨人年纪很大很大了,身体衰老得不行。	1
64	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
65	“我原来以为有些人生来就有帝王相呢，”他回答说，“不过也许你说的有道理。 	4
66	“是呀，这也正是我想知道的。”鸭妈妈说；她游到水塘的另一头，一头扎进水里倒立起来，让她的孩子们好好学学她的样子。 	0
67	Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.	0
68	And the sea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.	1
69	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
70	这个人为了爱情抛弃了上帝，终逃不脱上帝的审判，和他的情人双双躺在这里，快把他的尸体和他情人的尸体收起，埋到没人去的漂洗工墓地去，别往他们墓前立碑，什么痕迹也别留下，那样就都不知道他们葬身的地方了。 	1
71	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
72	For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain, has this my robe been woven. 	1
73	“今天夜里我要飞往埃及。”燕子说，为飞走一事兴奋不已。 	0
74	You will hear our gleeclub this evening.	0
75	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
76	他走啊走啊，一直走到森林的外围,他在这里看见成干上万的人在干河床上劳作。 	1
77	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	4
78	“一定是那个代表来了。”火箭说,努力做出很有尊严的样子。 	0
79	那是第二天就要举行加冕典礼的那天夜晚，年轻的国王独自坐在他的美丽的宫室里。	0
80	你不是说你把它卖了吗？干那种事可是很愚蠢的！' 	2
81	他害怕起来，赶紧把手闪开，那妖怪的手也赶紧闪开了。 	3
82	He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.	2
83	“这是因为你干了一件好事啊。”王子说。	0
84	But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.	1
85	Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,' cried the young Fisherman, and he took the little knife with its handle of green viper’s skin, and cut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before him, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.	2
86	在士兵周围拥挤的人群之中，他看见了他的母亲，那个要饭女人，她身边站着那个曾坐在路边等他的麻风病人。 	1
87	At last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings. 	0
88	‘That is because you have done a good action,’ said the Prince.	0
89	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
90	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	0
91	他重重地摔进了浪头里，他的伙伴赶快得得得跑走了。	1
92	For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,' she cried, and she ran out into the garden.	2
93	It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.	0
94	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
95	离这里不过一天的路程啊，就等你去了。 	1
96	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
97	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
98	“我不是要到埃及去，”燕子说，	1
99	“你当时在他身上发现什么标志没有？”她大声问道， 	2
100	The chief smiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.	0
101	“当然不是，”绿红雀回答说，“这才刚刚开始。” 	0
102	他们大多数人都兜售设拉子葡萄酒，那酒像蜜一样甜。 	0
103	在扁平的卵形盾上堆放着玉石，有红葡萄酒色，也有草绿色。 	0
104	And when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, 'I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that I may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom I love has her dwelling.	4
105	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
106	很遗憾，因为他长得奇丑无比，他才博得国王一笑。” 	1
107	‘This is a delightful spot,’ he said, ‘we must ask the Hail on a visit.’ 	0
108	我喜欢听我自己说话。	0
109	The Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the Spanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible, so fantastic a little monster had never been seen. 	0
110	他的心颤抖起来嘴里不由得叫出声来，他赶紧往阳光下走去。 	3
111	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
112	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
113	And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down he kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet them with his tears.	0
114	And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.	0
115	But the girl frowned.	1
116	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
117	 “我什么都不会送给你的。”贪婪说。	1
118	Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.’	3
119	“可我如何报答你呢，”星孩说，“你瞧！这可是你第三次救我了啊！”	4
120	So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.	3
121	When they caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the market– place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody. 	3
122	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	2
123	那神像是用乌木雕刻成的，雕像是人的样子。 	3
124	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
125	跟我走吧,我的儿子，我需要你的爰哪。	4
126	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	1
127	Romance is a thing of the past.	1
128	But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.	4
129	 And he told them his three dreams. 	1
130	'Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.	4
131	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
132	When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the house, but it was no longer there.	1
133	Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.	3
134	Canst thou make these things not to be? Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board? Shall the lion do thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee? Is not He who made misery wiser than thou art?	3
135	Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	4
136	A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes, answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper, and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
137	He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.	3
138	At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered on the colour he loved best.	0
139	“是我自己的。”每一个市议员都说，他们就吵了起来。 	2
140	Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller, friendship never forgets.	4
141	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.	0
142	Accursed be the Sea–folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them.	2
143	In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets.	0
144	The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.	0
145	突然间，一只狗在树林里叫起来，跳舞的人停了下来，双双走了过去，跪下来,亲吻那个人的手。 	4
146	这男人一时无话，但仍站在门前不动弹。 	3
147	One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.	1
148	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
149	‘'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	0
150	Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'	0
151	“我的心是我的恋人的，”他回答说，“用不着犹豫，只让你离开就行了。” 	2
152	我上一次见到他们,他们还在争吵昵。	2
153	我们坐在那里正在兴头上，一个老人朝我们走来,他拿着一块皮毯子和一把有两只琥珀角的鲁特琴。 	0
154	The King is there himself in his painted coffin.	1
155	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
156	“等月儿圆时，等月儿圆时。”她嘟哝说。 	1
157	这屋子现在用来作会议室，正中央的桌子上摆着大臣们的红色文件夹，盖着西班牙金郁金香徽，还有哈普斯堡皇家的纹章和标志。 	0
158	“真是奇怪，”他说，“天气虽然这么冷，我现在却觉得身上热乎乎的。” 	0
159	实际上，她和大多数艺术家没有什么两样；她就是花架子，不讲一点真诚。 	2
160	‘Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘will you not stay with me one night longer?’	4
161	How lucky you mentioned it!	0
162	We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.	0
163	这片树林从外面看去非常漂亮，好像到处都是欢唱的鸟儿，到处都是温馨的花朵，星孩满心高兴地走了进去。	0
164	听你谈论友谊是一种享受。我敢说连那个教士都说不出你这样中听的话，别看他住在一幢三层楼大住宅里，小拇指上还戴着一个金戒指。 	0
165	他们用小锡杯上酒,在酒面上撒些玫瑰叶子。 	0
166	He wandered all round looking for some place through which he might gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private door that was lying open.	0
167	And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'	0
168	But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.	1
169	太阳落山时他只好朝家的方向走去，哭得伤心极了，因为他知道什么命运在等着他。	1
170	商人虐待我们，我们必须对他们言听计从。	3
171	‘'It is quite mended,' answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.	0
172	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
173	‘Ahem! ahem!’ said the Rocket angrily.	2
174	月亮升上天空时，他飞回到快乐王子身边。	0
175	 I shall never get over it.	1
176	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
177	他在睡觉时做了一个梦，下面就是他的梦： 	0
178	沉重的眼皮从眼睛上垂下来。 	1
179	“皇帝把手从脸上拿开，对我说：'这是我的宝屋，其中一半是你的了，我说话是算数的。 	0
180	For how shall the people know that thou art a king, if thou hast not a king’s raiment?'	3
181	你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
182	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.	4
183	‘'Who is there?' cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window.	3
184	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
185	For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away.	1
186	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
187	“啊呀，老公啊！”她嘟哝说，“难道我们自家的孩子还不够多，你非要捡一个弃儿往咱炉边挤吗？	2
188	Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells.	0
189	Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy our King over us.'	0
190	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.	1
191	巨人对所有孩子都非常和蔼，可他仍一心想念他的第一个小朋友,经常说起他。 	4
192	所以去把它取来吧，世界的财富就都是你的了。” 	0
193	And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.	1
194	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
195	就算它们是真的爆竹，那也不会比这看上去好看。 	0
196	I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'	0
197	‘Will you come away with me?’ he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.	1
198	新信徒从小门往外看看，看清了来人是谁，把门栓拉开，对他说：“进来吧。” 	4
199	她像影子一样掠过花园，像影子一样穿过树林。 	3
200	至于我，我不需要这些东西。 	1
201	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
202	They had seen him often in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the hollow of some old oak–tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels. 	0
203	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
204	附近有一个小城，城里有一座鹅掌楸花园。 	0
205	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
206	我们都有几手专长，这就够吃遍天下了。 	0
207	王子和公主从此再没有幸福可言，他们的婚姻生活全都蒙上了阴影,至于国王，我知道他简直过不了这关。	1
208	他浑身贴满了一片片赤金叶子，眼睛含着两颗晶莹的蓝宝石，佩剑的剑柄上镶嵌了一颗大红宝石，闪闪发光。	0
209	他的头发焦黄干涩，嘴唇红得如石榴，眼睛很大的却混沌不清。 	1
210	But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.	1
211	突然，一声尖厉的干咳声传来，他们纷纷四下张望。 	3
212	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。 	3
213	The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.	0
214	死亡对她说：“你手里拿着什么？” 	3
215	他不准许任何人虐待鸟儿和野兽，而是教人懂得爱、亲情和仁慈；他向穷人发放面包，向衣不蔽体的人发放衣服，在他的国土上，到处一片祥和富足的景象。	4
216	至于我的灵魂嘛，如果它横阻在我和我所爰的东西之间,那对我又有什么好处呢？” 	1
217	I stood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.	1
218	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
219	的确，他只懂两种调子，却又从来弄不清楚他正在吹奏哪一种；但是这丝毫没有关系，因为不管他吹奏成什么样子，谁都得大声喝彩 	0
220	Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, but I am really very busy today.	1
221	When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the hand, and placed me by his side.	4
222	不过我现在说也不晚。”于是，他扯尖嗓子嚷嚷了一声“呸”，尾巴嗖地甩了一下，钻回他的洞里去了。 	2
223	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
224	Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him, I answered.	4
225	The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance.	0
226	这天也确实是一个名副其实的好日子。 	0
227	“什么秘密？”巫婆问道，像一只野猫一样跟他较劲，紧紧咬着沾满白沫的嘴唇。 	2
228	‘'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'	2
229	‘I have a golden bedroom,’ he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.	1
230	黑色的海越逼越近，白色的浪沫像麻风病人一样呻吟。 	3
231	He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.	3
232	我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
233	国王的儿子要结婚，各种大庆小庆是少不了的。	0
234	但是，小矮人真的难以抗拒，西班牙宫廷虽然历来以高雅的对于恐怖的激情而著称，却也从来没有见过这样好看好玩儿的小怪物。 	0
235	She shook her head. 	1
236	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
237	那年轻的大学生还躺在草地上，和她飞走时看见的一样，他那双美丽的眼睛里的泪水还没干呢。	1
238	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
239	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
240	然而，捕鱼的小伙子置之不理，他的爱情的力量太强大了。 	4
241	然而等他来到树林外围，他听见灌木丛里传来一声痛苦的尖叫。	1
242	在一座桥拱下面，两个小男孩儿紧紧依偎着取暖。	1
243	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？	2
244	到我的城市上空去飞一趟，小燕子，回来告诉我你在下面看见了什么。” 	0
245	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
246	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
247	But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth. 	2
248	他一次又一次浮上来，每一次上来他都带来一颗美丽的珍珠。 	0
249	但是他皱着眉把她推开，对她说:“如果你不信守你向我发下的誓言，我就把你当假巫婆杀死。” 	2
250	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
251	灵魂回答说：“走近一点，我跟你说说话，我看见许多罕见的事情。” 	0
252	‘'A great loss to me at any rate,' answered the Miller; 'why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don't know what to do with it.	1
253	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
254	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
255	All the things in God’s world he blessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.	0
256	“很适合你听听。”绿红雀回答说;他飞下树枝，落在池岸上，开始讲忠诚朋友的故事。  	4
257	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
258	“不，”捕鱼的小伙子大叫道，“我静不下来，你让我干的每件事我都厌恶。 	2
259	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.	0
260	‘How happy we are here!’ they cried to each other.	0
261	我告诉他们我所干过的事后，他们每个人都送给我一个神像，求我离开他们。 	1
262	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	1
263	She was like a white rose before, said a young Page to his neighbour, "but she is like a red rose now", and the whole Court was delighted.	0
264	For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin?	3
265	The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. 	0
266	Goodbye, cried the Fireballoon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.	0
267	Inside it is even as a bazaar.	0
268	我什么都不会给你的，她喃喃地说。	1
269	Here, in the Palace, the air was close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.	0
270	Now when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran out into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.	0
271	And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god.	1
272	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	2
273	But the little ducks paid no attention to her.	1
274	The river–horses raged against us and sought to slay us.	3
275	And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, 'Why dost thou call to me?'	2
276	So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.	0
277	“别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	0
278	“有人开始赏识我了，”他惊叫道，这一定是某个了不起的崇拜者送来的。	0
279	Thy mother dwells not in this city.	1
280	It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.	0
281	That is capital,' said the Infanta, after a pause; 'but now you must dance for me.'	0
282	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
283	And yet I will not wear this robe, nor will I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so will I go forth from it. 	1
284	但是孩子们一看见他，吓得胆战心惊，纷纷逃跑了,花园又变成了冬天。	3
285	我没有听他们的，却走过去和兜售古怪神像的贩子坐在一起,他们因为干这一行深遭人痛恨。 	2
286	“我走近他们时，商人的头儿站起来,抽出腰刀，问我有何公干。 	2
287	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
288	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	3
289	And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.	0
290	But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and sawAh! what did he see?	3
291	他早先去拜访他的朋友、康沃尔的吃人魔去了，和吃人魔一呆就是七年。	3
292	Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her dress as she walked.	0
293	The dry thorn blossomed, and bare roses that were redder than rubies. 	0
294	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
295	I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.	2
296	Should I not love also?' asked his Soul.	4
297	Nor came the Sea–folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.	1
298	商人们坐在他们摊位前的丝绸毯子上。 	0
299	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
300	‘Give me a red rose,’ she cried, ‘and I will sing you my sweetest song.’	0
301	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
302	The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business.	3
303	不管怎样他应该去看个究竟。 	3
304	He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace—Joyeuse, as they called it—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh–fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the council– board or audience–chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from sickness. 	1
305	When the camels saw them they trembled.	3
306	“我们从蹴題人国进入诅咒月亮的人的国家。 	3
307	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？	4
308	Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round.	0
309	“不，什么都不如财富好。”灵魂说。 	0
310	巨人的花园总是冬天，北风、冰雹、霜和雪在树间肆意起舞。	1
311	At last, however, after a prolonged combat, during which several of the hobby–horses were gored through and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of Tierra–Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained permission from the Infanta to give the coup de grace, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head came right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de Lorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.	0
312	‘And what would you do in return?’ said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	0
313	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
314	As she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again. 	0
315	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
316	于是他们进了城，走过街道，就在穿过珠宝商街时，捕鱼的小伙子看见一个摊位上摆着一个银杯， 	0
317	‘You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,’ cried the Student.	0
318	捕鱼的小伙子顿时脸色煞白，攥紧两手，大叫道：“她是一个假巫婆，她沒有跟我说这话。” 	3
319	He crept wearily down the ladder, and disappeared into the sea. 	1
320	“快去叫一个掌鞭高手来。”唐•彼德罗不耐烦地说，走回到平台上。 	2
321	“这个有趣的小矮人生气了，”她叫道，“你一定要叫他起来，让他给我跳舞。 	2
322	他穿着漂亮的王服，站立在他们面前，风琴弹岀了乐曲，号手吹响了他们的号角，童子唱起了圣诗。	0
323	“世上还真有不折不扣的情种，”夜莺说， 	4
324	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
325	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
326	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
327	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.	4
328	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
329	May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?’	3
330	他们终于脱险，因此高兴得不知怎么才好，哈哈大笑起来，大地在他们看来像一朵银花，月亮则像一朵金花。	0
331	你的意见太好了，我得先按你说的办，不想银扣子的事了。'他跑去把美丽的迎春花全都拔来，装满了磨坊主的篮子。 	0
332	这地方气候干燥，赤日炎炎。 	1
333	But the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was undoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf. 	0
334	他身后继位的人却以恶治国。	2
335	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
336	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	1
337	你的画像很美丽，他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。	0
338	这乐曲在他耳际萦绕，妙不可言，他原以为一定是国王的乐师演奏着曲子走过。	0
339	I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world.	0
340	He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.	0
341	他又抽泣起来，说，母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
342	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
343	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
344	“你挑选对了，”上帝说，“因为在我的乐园里，这只小鸟会永远唱下去，而在我的金子城市里，快乐王子会赞美我的。”	0
345	There is a little city hard by in which there is a garden of tulip–trees.	0
346	“我路过庭院时，两个头罩纱巾的女人从阳台上往下看，咒骂我。 	2
347	西班牙公主只有十二岁，太阳把宫殿花园照得一片灿烂。 	0
348	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受。	1
349	卫兵从城垛间往下看，问我们有何公干。 	3
350	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
351	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
352	这世界的确非常美丽，一个小爆筒大声说。	0
353	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	4
354	You seem not to learn anything.	2
355	Even the cattle of the field praise Him.	0
356	他对所有的市民都主持公道，施与慈悲；他把那个邪恶的魔术师驱逐岀去，给那个樵夫和他老伴儿送去许多丰厚的礼物，并且对他们的孩子封官晋爵。	4
357	‘Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,’ she murmured.	1
358	Accept me in the hour of my humility.	1
359	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
360	‘I don't think much of that,’ said the Duck, ‘as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
361	可是夜莺明白这位大学生的苦衷，呆在栎树丛里一声不吭，默想着爱情的秘密所在。	1
362	树间到处是猿和孔雀。	0
363	“我有许多美丽的花儿，”他说，“可是孩子们才是所有花中最美丽的花朵啊。”	0
364	“你怎么一点儿都不像快乐王子 呢？” 一位明白事理的母亲对着自己无理哭闹的小孩儿说， 	2
365	神父拍了拍他的胸膛，回答说：“呜呼，呜呼，你疯了，要不就是吃了什么有毒的药灵魂是人类最咼贵的部分，是上帝赐予我们的，我们应该极好地使用它。 	4
366	He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and rushing forward struck at me with great violence.	3
367	每天晚上他都出海捕鱼，一天晚上网子异常沉重，他简直无法把网子拉到船上去。 	3
368	Receive thy child now.'	0
369	And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.	1
370	And the Linnet answered, Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
371	He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.	1
372	“'如果葡萄酒十分上口我会和他一起喝几杯；如果葡萄酒十分苦涩，那我也会和他同杯共饮。'我回答说。 	4
373	And Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water, and out of the cup rose Ague. 	0
374	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
375	And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.	0
376	他立即进了门，把那孩子塞进她的怀里；她亲过孩子，把他放在他们家最小的孩子躺着的小床上。	4
377	他到处寻找，却总找不到魔术师说的那块白金，找啊找啊，从早上找到中午，从中午找到夕阳西下。	1
378	‘I am going to the House of Death.	3
379	Then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.	3
380	He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.	0
381	‘'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller; 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
382	When they are glad they go to the bird–sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.	1
383	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	1
384	“我看春天终于来了。”巨人说，他从床上跳下，往外张望。	0
385	“春天把这花园遗忘了，”他们大叫着，“这下我们可以一年到头住在这里了。”	0
386	Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	0
387	他们俩有一个比同伴跑得快，抢先从柳树中穿过去，从另一边跑岀来，瞧！白雪里真的有一样金玩意儿。 	0
388	那是花园最远的角落,一个小男孩儿正站在那里。 	1
389	I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	1
390	但是他紧紧地把她抱住不放，不让她逃走。 	4
391	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
392	‘What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?’ he said; ‘I must look for a good chimneypot,’ and he determined to fly away.	1
393	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	4
394	随后十点钟敲响了，然后是点,然后是十二点，午夜钟声敲完最后一下时,每个人都走出房子，来到阳台，国王命人去叫皇家焰火匠。 	0
395	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
396	They acted so well, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of the play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears. Indeed some of the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats, and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires, should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.	1
397	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道。	2
398	人的灵魂比什么都宝贵，世间万物都没法与它相比， 	4
399	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	1
400	苍白的病恢恢的孩子们蜷缩在大梁上。	1
401	In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.	1
402	一个身穿绿皮束腰长袍的亚美尼亚人从小门往外窥视，见是他们一伙就把门打开，在地上铺了一条地毯，轿里的女人跨出轿来。 	0
403	And I said to the priest, ‘Is this the god?’ And he answered me, ‘This is the god.’	3
404	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
405	When the moon is full, when the moon is full,' she muttered.	3
406	Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other. 	3
407	“不吻，”星孩说，“你的样子太脏,我能吻蛭蛇和癞蛤蟆都不会吻你。” 	2
408	Three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them.	3
409	“凭着山羊的蹄子起誓，我一定办到。”她回答说。 	0
410	“我问那僧侣说：'这就是那个神吗？' 	2
411	Who is thy master?' asked the young King. 	3
412	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
413	There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry, and a brass–sealed ceiling hung with lamps.	0
414	And when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his Soul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he fell upon the ground weeping bitterly.	1
415	It stopped opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed. Thou canst not think how strange a people they are.	0
416	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
417	The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of them in the throat. 	3
418	他过去从来没有如此急切地,或说如此狂喜地感受到诸多美丽的东西的魔力和真谛。	0
419	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
420	他高兴得大叫起来，跑了过去，跪下来亲吻他母亲脚上的伤口，眼泪都把伤口打湿了。	0
421	He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails. 	0
422	红玫瑰比红宝石还鲜红啊，玫瑰的叶子就是年殳扁的金子。	0
423	The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms, he threw it at me.	3
424	And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him.	0
425	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!” 	1
426	但是那麻风病人一言不发。	1
427	它右手握着一根带钩的翡翠权杖，另一只手里拿着一个圆水晶球。 	0
428	这是一场洋洋大观的婚礼，在一顶缀满珍珠的紫色天鹅绒华盖下，新娘和新郎手拉手缓缓走过。	0
429	他回答说：“我母亲是一个要饭的,就和我一样，我很恶劣地对待过她，我求你让我进去，她也许会原谅我，要是她真的呆在这座城里的话。” 	4
430	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说，	2
431	但是他对老婆说：“我在树林里拾到一样东西，就给你带来了，让你照管他站在门边没有进来。 	0
432	他有一对贼亮的圆溜溜的眼睛，硬刷刷的灰胡子，尾巴长得像一截长长的黑橡皮。 	3
433	The walls are cased with copper, and the watch–towers on the walls are roofed with brass.	0
434	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
435	And the Squirrel answered, Thou hast slain mine.	2
436	For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.	0
437	“我现在要爆破了，”他嚷道， 	2
438	可是别提灵魂，它对我们毫无用处，对我们的行当也毫无价值。” 	1
439	Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his country, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the New World. 	1
440	What a pity!	1
441	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
442	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？” 	1
443	我死后，他们把我安置在这顶天立地的地儿，我一下看见了这城里的一切丑陋和苦难；虽然我的心是铅做的，可我还是忍不住哭泣啊。” 	1
444	“'这板子不怎么大呀，'磨坊主打量着板子说，'恐怕我堵上我的仓库顶后就留不下你修理手推车的料了；不过这当然不是我的错。 	1
445	他的所有穷亲戚他都从来不屑一顾,嗤之以鼻，这时却纷纷冲上天际，在一片片火光中像美妙的金花儿。	0
446	但是那个巨人深爱的小男孩儿再也没有露面。	1
447	Behind him stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his confessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side. 	2
448	“我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。 	1
449	‘The god is asleep,’ he murmured.	1
450	鸟儿们到处飞动，高兴得叽叽喳喳鸣叫，花儿从绿草地往上张望，喜笑颜开。	0
451	因为花园里没有孩子们，鸟儿不愿意在里面唱歌，桃树也忘记开花了。	1
452	它的额头有一枚红宝石，厚厚的油脂从头发滴落到了它的大腿上。 	0
453	我们今后怎么养活他呢？她生丈夫的气了。	2
454	白天我和我的小伙伴儿在花园里玩耍，晩上我在大厅里领头跳舞。	0
455	It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.	0
456	“无上荣耀呀！”全体朝臣纷纷道贺说。	0
457	From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them. 	1
458	但是冬天把我的叶脉冻坏了，霜冻摧毁了我的花蕾，暴风雨折断了我的树枝，今年我没法开玫瑰花了。	1
459	一匹戴着银鞍具的小马跑来迎接他。 	0
460	“这里可不怎么舒服，”他说，不过这里肯定是个时髦的水疗场，他们送我来休养身体的。	1
461	他也算是一个政治家了，在地方选举中还总能居领先地位，因此对议会的一套行话了如指掌。 	0
462	可是孩子们说他们并不知道他住在哪里，过去从来也没有见过他；巨人觉得伤心极了。	1
463	国宴过后是舞会。 	0
464	他们于是进了城，穿过街道，路过拖鞋商街，捕鱼的小伙子看见一个孩子站在水罐旁边。 	1
465	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
466	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
467	“不！ ”孩子回答说，“这是爱的伤痕呀。”	4
468	The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. 	0
469	‘Of myself,’ said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.	2
470	‘What a silly question!’ cried the Waterrat.	2
471	Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.	3
472	“音乐家们会在他们的乐池里就座，”年轻的大学生说，“弹奏他们的乐器，我的情人儿会随着竖琴和小提琴的乐曲翩翩起舞。她会跳得脚下生风，连地都不沾，那些献殷勤的人穿戴得漂漂亮亮,纷纷围着她打转转。 	0
473	在他身旁的草地上放着一顶羽饰的帽子，一双镶嵌花边的骑马戴的长腕手套，上面用珍珠缀岀一种奇特的图案。 	0
474	但是，瞧！他走过城门时，卫兵们点头哈腰向他行礼，说：“我们的君主多么美啊！”一群市民追随在他身后，大声嚷叫说：“这全世界都没有这么美的人啊！”	0
475	one heart to suffer. 	1
476	By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,' she made answer.	3
477	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
478	我终于能在我的花园里干活儿了，真是再快乐不过。'他说完，马上开始去劳作了。 	0
479	‘Ah! what a trivial view of life!’ said the Rocket; ‘but it is only what I expected.	2
480	“你好冷酷啊。 	2
481	And his Soul mocked him and said, 'Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love.	1
482	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
483	小汉斯呀，大夫。‘ 	4
484	Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.	0

878	我们先是和马加达人打仗，他们生下来就是老人，每活年年轻一岁，等他们成了小孩儿就死去了；接着和拉克特罗伊人打仗，他们说他们是老虎的儿子，把自己涂得黄黑相间;随后是和奥兰特斯人打仗，他们把他们的死者葬在树梢，而他们自己却住在黑洞里,生怕见到太阳，因太阳是他们的神，会把他们杀死；接下来和克里姆尼安人打仗,他们崇拜鳄鱼,用青草慰劳鳄鱼，还喂鳄鱼黄油和活鸡活鸭；再就是和阿加宗巴人打仗，他们长着狗一样的脸；然后是和西邦人打仗，他们长着马一样的蹄子，跑起来比马还快。 	3

883	The Infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of siesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra–Nueva for his charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children following in the same order in which they had entered.	0

938	‘For a red rose?’ they cried; ‘how very ridiculous!’ and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	2
939	说实话，痛苦才是这世界的主宰，谁都逃不过它的网。 	1
940	“瞧，快瞧！”玫瑰树招呼说，“这朵玫瑰终于培育成了。”但是夜莺没有回答，因为她躺在深草丛中，死了，心上带着那根刺儿。	1
941	他用柳条抽它，它就呜呜叫着离去了。 	1
942	丝绸床罩上绣着淡白罂粟花，仿佛它们是从入睡者疲劳的手里落下来的；高高的槽形象牙细柱子把天鹅绒华盖支撑起来，华盖上翻上去一束束硕大的鸵鸟羽毛，如白色泡沫，直指银白色的回纹装饰天花板。 	0
943	他们把我赶岀了城门，谁都不管我的死活。	2
944	After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly–lit room. 	1

953	随后他就松开两臂放开她，她落进水里，因莫名的恐惧浑身发抖。 	3
954	可是，我一点儿也不在乎。 	1
955	‘'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy today.	1

959	尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	1
960	So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to them, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo! there was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of round metal set on an altar of stone.	3
961	So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.	1
962	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。	1
963	骆驼看见它们时都在发抖。 	3
964	所以我对你所干的事情不赞成，劝你掉转马头回宫,让自己脸上高兴起来，穿上那套适合国王身份的衣服，戴上那顶我将为你加冕的皇冠，拿起那根我将交付你手的珍珠权杖。 	0
965	“'一块板子!磨坊主说，'噫，我修补我的仓库顶正需要一块板子呢。仓库顶上那窟窿可真叫大呀，我要不赶紧堵上,里面的玉米就该淋湿了。 	3
966	他飞进了黑賤駿的小巷，看见挨饿的孩子面色惨白,无可奈何地望着黑乎乎的街道。	1
967	一个样子凶恶的老头儿正好路过，大声吆喝说：“我出这个价买下他。”他把钱付清后，领着星孩进了城。	3
968	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
969	‘It is your garden now, little children,’ said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. 	0
970	她做了一个表示失望的小怪相，并耸了耸双肩。 	1
971	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
972	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。 	4
973	他穿着一身灰色服装，他吐出的气跟冰差不多。	1
974	比如说,假如今天夜里我有个三长两短，这对谁来说都是一大不幸！	1
975	So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young Fisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.	0
976	He saw a most wonderful sight. 	0
977	“可怜的小汉斯对这一要求什么话也不敢多说，第二天一大早磨坊主把自己的羊群赶到小农舍前，汉斯接上羊群到山上放去了。 	1
978	Their fat bodies swayed as they walked, and they glanced curiously at me with their yellow–lidded eyes.	3
979	‘My own garden is my own garden,’ said the Giant; ‘any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.’	2
980	As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.	0
981	Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.	0
982	野猪在山谷里拱吃玉米的根，狐狸咬断山间的葡萄藤。	3
983	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	3
984	我触摸了他的两眼,它们马上瞎了。 	1
985	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
986	“爱情比智慧更好。”他大声说，“小小美人鱼爰我呀。” 	4
987	Suffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.'	0
988	The love of the body is vile,' cried the Priest, knitting his brows, 'and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world. Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea! I have heard them at night–time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads. They tap at the window, and laugh. They whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.	2
989	All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.	0
990	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
991	我用一只转轮能把月亮从天上拉下来，我还能让你在水晶里看见死神。 	3
992	孩子们组成一个圈子，扇着手中的大扇子，彼此低声交谈，唐•彼德罗和大法庭庭长站在圈子入口处笑容满面。 	0

995	And his Soul said to him, 'Smite that child.' So he smote the child till it wept, and when he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.	1
996	But he said to them, 'I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who bare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.	1
997	我怎么能飞起来呢？ 	1
998	Are we not all kinsmen?' said the merchant.	4
999	‘You are a very irritating person,’ said the Rocket, ‘and very illbred.	2
1000	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
1001	可是星孩说：不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
1002	When we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of brass, and they let us go by.	3
1003	“得得得，是我说到焰火技术的，”火箭说，口气十分严厉，信号焰火觉得当头挨了一棒，立即对身边的小爆筒开始吹胡子瞪眼睛，显示他不管怎样都是有身份的人物。 	2
1004	‘'Ah'! said the Miller, 'there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.'	0
1005	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
1006	已经是冬天了，燕子回答说，这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	1
1007	一个人出手大方也往往苦不堪言。‘ 	1
1008	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
1009	‘'Goodbye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
1010	How he wished that he had gone back with her!	1
1011	Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.	0
1012	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
1013	天气确实冷得要命。 	3
1014	“不，”他叫道,“我决不搭理你了,不和你去任何地方了,就像我过去打发走你那样，我现在就打发走你，因为你让我不干好事。” 	2
1015	在场的每个人都兴趣盎然，他们神态庄严地在多姿多态的舞姿中穿插走动，徐缓的动作和大方的躬身行礼都显得极为优雅，那样子太迷人了；等他们完成了表演，向小公主脱下他们的大羽毛帽子致敬时，小公主也毕恭毕敬地频频还礼，并且一口保证送一支大蜡烛给德•彼拉圣母的神龛，报答圣母赐给她这一欢乐。 	0
1016	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
1017	但是捕鱼的小伙子回答说：“要我放你走也不难，只要你答应我，不管多会儿我呼喊你，你都要来给我唱歌，因为鱼儿都喜欢听海民唱歌，这样我可以把我的网子捞满了。” 	0
1018	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a notebook, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	0
1019	小侍从见了吃了一惊，瞪起他那蓝蓝的大眼睛，微笑着跟他说：“陛下，我看你有皇袍和权杖，可你的皇冠在哪里呢？ 	3
1020	钟楼响起午夜钟声时，他按响了铃,他的侍从进来毕恭毕敬地给他宽衣解带,给他倒上玫瑰水洗手，往他的枕头上撤了花瓣儿。 	0
1021	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	4
1022	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
1023	这是我的一大乐趣。	0
1024	“'今天的活儿可真累得够呛，'小汉斯一边上床睡觉一边心下琢磨，'不过好在我没有拒绝磨坊主，他毕竟是我最好的朋友，况且他还要送我他的手推车呢。' 	0
1025	他脸上盖着一块灰色的麻布头巾，从小网眼儿里他的眼睛闪射出灼人的光芒。 	3
1026	哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	1
1027	But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, 'Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.'	1
1028	“这位穿戴得像一个乞丐的国王在哪里就是给我们王国带来耻辱的男孩儿？我们一定要杀了他,他根本不配统治我们。”	2
1029	你一定不要在意我跟你说话心直口快。 	4
1030	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	1
1031	但是谁都不敢看他的脸，只因他的脸像天使的圣容。	4
1032	可是玫瑰树还是揺头。 	1
1033	那些男孩儿都身穿白天鹅绒古式宫廷服装，他们那古怪的三角帽垂悬着银穗子，上面插满了硕大的鸵鸟羽毛；他们在阳光下翩翩起舞，他们那耀眼的白色服装在他们黝黑的脸和长长的黑头发映衬下，显得更加醒目。 	0
1034	The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.	0
1035	他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
1036	“门口站着磨坊主，一手提着灯笼,另一只手拄着长棍子。 	3
1037	In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.	2
1038	再往后是德•彼拉圣母教堂舞蹈班男孩儿们表演肃穆的小步舞，十分迷人。 	0
1039	她沉到水下，恋恋不舍地看着他。 	1
1040	He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as cold as ice.	0
1041	他一时忘了自己的忧愁，返身跑到那儿，看见一只小兔子掉进了猎人设下的陷阱。	1
1042	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
1043	“‘好多人做得不错，’磨坊主回答说，‘可是很少有人说得不错，这说明说话要比做事难得多啊，因此也就是更值得干的事情了。'他隔着桌子严厉地看着他的小儿子，这个小孩儿因此觉得无地自容,把头垂得低低的，满脸通红，眼泪流进了他的茶水里。 	1
1044	所以我一定要离开这里，走遍全世界也要找到她，直到得到她的原谅。” 	1
1045	为那些坏事你犯得着烦恼吗？ 	1
1046	Could the shadows of things have colour and life and movement?	3
1047	“我很高兴你终于要去埃及了，小燕子，”王子说，“你在这里呆得够长了,不过你一定要亲亲我的嘴唇，因为我爱你呀。”	4
1048	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
1049	“可我要是能帮助你该多好啊。”捕鱼的小伙子说。 	4
1050	He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.	3
1051	He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.	0
1052	But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.	3
1053	红雀儿回答说，你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
1054	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
1055	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
1056	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
1057	起初花儿苍白得像悬浮在河面上的薄雾一苍白得像早晨的纤脚，然后它变成了银白色，活像拂晓的双翼。	0
1058	And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.	0
1059	'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.	1
1060	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
1061	And the Queen said to him, 'This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.'	4
1062	“旧棍子！”火箭说，不可能！金棍子，这才是他应该叫的。	2
1063	“高兴起来吧，”夜莺尖声说，高兴起来吧,你会得到你的红玫瑰的。	0
1064	For accursed were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.'	2
1065	百合花比精选的珍珠还白净啊，百合花的茎比银子还纏亮。	0
1066	小公主只好一本正经地站起来,下命令要小矮人午睡后再来给她跳舞,并向年轻的新地伯爵这番迷人的款待表示了感谢，然后返回她的住所，那群孩子们仍按来时的顺序跟岀去了。 	0
1067	“你看河鼠这家伙怎么样？”鸭妈妈说完，扑扑啦啦打了一会儿水， 	2
1068	“放开我，”她叫喊说,“让我走啊。 	2
1069	You are a very irritating person, said the Rocket, and very illbred.	2
1070	政府为什么连管也不管呢？	2
1071	They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet blossoms. 	2
1072	这下我能写完我的剧本了，他看上去相当幸福。	0
1073	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
1074	“那么，请问，你认为忠诚的朋友有哪些责任呢？”附近柳树上的一只绿红雀听见了这场谈话，问道。 	4
1075	离天亮还有三个小时，夜幕依然黑沉沉的，他的灵魂却弄醒他，对他说：“快起来到商人的房间去，就到他睡觉的那间屋子，把他杀了，拿走他的金子，我们需要金子。” 	3
1076	“我从来没有说过他们赶上了倒霉的事，”火箭答道，“我只是说他们也许会有不幸。 	1
1077	秋天给每一座花园带来了金色的果实,但是巨人的花园却得不到秋天的垂青。	1
1078	And so large was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a palace of a King.	0
1079	The Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at the behaviour of the birds. 	2
1080	燕子于是啄下来一片又一片赤金，把快乐王子啄得寸金不留,一副灰不溜丢的样子。 	0
1081	‘I am going to Egypt’! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.	1
1082	I have many beautiful flowers, he said, "but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."	4
1083	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
1084	He could make little cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.	0
1085	那些愚蠢的国事有什么了不起? 	2
1086	‘What a curious thing!’ he cried; ‘there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.	0
1087	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
1088	他们在我身边悄悄念叨他们寻欢作乐的故事。 	1
1089	但是我没有在意。 	1
1090	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
1091	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
1092	他甩了甩头，笑笑。 	0
1093	The adders hissed at him as he went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch. 	3
1094	海豚围着她转呀转，野海鸥在她头上盘旋。 	0
1095	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
1096	‘Well, that is his loss, not mine,’ answered the Rocket.	2
1097	I am laughing because I am happy, replied the Cracker.	0
1098	我根本不是你的儿子。	2
1099	And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.	1
1100	告诉我，你能看见我的母亲吗？” 	1
1101	You will wear it tonight next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	4
1102	The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands.	0
1103	He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.	0
1104	月亮圆的时候，我会跟你在一起，在草地上一起跳舞。” 	0
1105	Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'	4
1106	后来，燕子飞回到了快乐王子身边，跟快乐王子讲了他做过的事。 	0
1107	And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	0
1108	雪橇的样子像一只金色大天鹅，这位纤巧的公主本人坐在天鹅的翅膀中间。	0
1109	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
1110	小松鼠生活在局杉树洞里，不停地互相蹭鼻子保持暖和,兔子在他们的窝里蜷成一团，根本不敢贸然到窝口来探头探脑。	3
1111	At the prow of the galley sat a shark–charmer, beating monotonously upon a drum. 	1
1112	“我就住那儿去吧。”他叫道，“那是个好去处，新鲜空气有的是。”	0
1113	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶。”	3
1114	A jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him.	0
1115	他是一个非常自私的巨人。 	2
1116	随后他打开圣龛，对着里面的圣体匣焚香，向人们展示洁净的圣饼，接着把它放在纱幕后面，开始向人们布道，本想向他们讲出上帝的神谴。 	0
1117	我们和那些辛辛苦苦为我们劳作的人有什么关系？一个人非得亲眼看见播种的人才可以吃面包吗？一个人非得和踩榨葡萄酒的人交谈过才可以喝葡萄酒吗？	2
1118	The people marvelled at my boldness, and counselled me to flee from the city.	3
1119	‘Order! order!’ cried out a Cracker.	2
1120	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
1121	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
1122	“尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	4
1123	但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。	0
1124	他对着尸体忏悔。 	1
1125	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
1126	‘The world is certainly very beautiful,’ cried a little Squib.	0
1127	大小报纸纷纷极尽溢美之词，赞扬他表演得淋漓尽致。 	0
1128	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.	3
1129	It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.’	1
1130	我很容易就把它修好了，我房子里正好有一块板子。’ 	0
1131	海盗在荒芜的海岸劫掠，把渔民的船烧掉，抢走他们的渔网。	3
1132	但是，天哪！斗篷里面没有金子，也没有银子，当然也没有什么宝贝，只有一个小孩儿睡在里面。 	1
1133	墙上覆盖了一块粉色的卢卡花缎，上面有鸟的图案，还点缀着俏丽的银色花朵;家具是用银子堆成的，装饰着华丽的花冠和转动的丘比特；两个大壁炉前都摆放着绣有鹦鹉和孔雀的大型屏风；地是用海绿色玛瑙砌的，一眼看去延伸到了很远的地方。 	0
1134	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，”她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂，	1
1135	And after a time she clenched her hands in anger.	2
1136	‘'Little Hans, Doctor.'	0
1137	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
1138	In fact the gipsies were a great success.	0
1139	你一脸幸福哪。	0
1140	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
1141	这可是世间最红的玫瑰。	0
1142	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the noticeboard it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
1143	高兴起来吧。	0
1144	Art thou a spy set on us by our master?'	3
1145	The Emperor touched one of the walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches.	0
1146	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
1147	Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch for couch.	1
1148	她走进小门时又回身冲我一笑。 	0
1149	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
1150	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
1151	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
1152	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.’	0
1153	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	0
1154	可怜的孩子们这下没有地方可玩儿了。	1
1155	Nay,' answered his Soul, 'but she was true to Him she worships, and whose servant she will be ever.'	4
1156	他打了它一下，它立即还了一下。 	0
1157	星孩走出了城门，来到了魔术师告诉他的那片树林旁边。 	3
1158	The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper.	0
1159	He quivered for a little, and then he was still. 	1
1160	“嗨哟嗨哟！ ”他们每拽出一只箱子就喊一声。 	0
1161	And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.	0
1162	‘My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotusflowers.	0
1163	It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow–trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s–throw away.	0
1164	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
1165	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
1166	苍白的月儿听见了，把黎明忘在脑后，滞留在天空不肯离去。	0
1167	“你的画像很美丽他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。 	0
1168	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
1169	Pretty boy, pretty boy,' she muttered, 'that is a terrible thing to do.'	2
1170	‘No, little Swallow,’ said the poor Prince, ‘you must go away to Egypt.’	1
1171	于是燕子在城市上空飞翔，看见富人在他们美丽的宅邸寻欢作乐，而乞丐坐在大门前行乞。 	1
1172	“我和你再呆一个夜晚吧，”燕子说，真的动了恻隐之心。	4
1173	And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.	4
1174	他的脚掌和手掌是金黄色的。 	0
1175	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	0
1176	He should drink poppy–juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,' said the great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry. 	2
1177	那是十年前的今天吗？” 	1
1178	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你对待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
1179	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
1180	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。”	4
1181	他们把柴火堆成了堆，火箭放在了最上面，然后点上了火。 	0
1182	有时则有一些养鹰人头戴绿色的绒便帽，身穿熟制的鹿皮夹克匆匆走过，手腕上站着蒙住头的鹰。 	3
1183	They are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.'	2
1184	屋子是空的。 	1
1185	我走进去时，他们把我身后的门一道道关上，用铁链拴上。 	3
1186	夜莺于是飞到了生长在古老的日晷旁的那棵玫瑰树上。 	0
1187	除了非凡的火箭，每一个都表演得非常成功。	0
1188	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cartwheel went over it.	2
1189	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
1190	他疲乏地爬下绳梯，消失在海中。 	1
1191	它的脚是红的，沾满了新杀死的孩子的血，它的腰间系着一条铜腰带，上面钉着七颗绿玉。 	3
1192	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
1193	But the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them down, and trampled on them.	2
1194	“我愿意再和你呆一个夜晚，”燕子说，可是我不忍心啄掉你的眼睛。	1
1195	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	1
1196	I will not give thee anything,' said Avarice, and she hid her hand in the fold of her raiment. 	2
1197	So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.	0
1198	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
1199	And he said to her, 'Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.	1
1200	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	2
1201	贫穷从我们不见阳光的小巷溜进来，瞪着饥饿的眼睛；罪恶面无表情地接踵而来。	3
1202	The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no man has care of us. 	1
1203	And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.	1
1204	捕鱼的小伙子干恩万谢,亲吻商人手上的戒指，随后躺在染过的山羊毛织的毯子上。 	4
1205	他朝它鞠了一个嘲弄的躬，它也朝他鞠一个嘲弄的躬。 	2
1206	In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.	0
1207	不过，这些孩子看见它们的花花点点的膨颈和一伸一缩的芯子，吓得什么似的,倒是更喜欢看见玩儿杂耍的从沙里变出一棵小小的橘子树，让树上开满漂亮的白花,结岀累累果实；后来他拿过拉斯托雷斯侯爵小女儿的扇子，一下子变出一只蓝色的鸟儿，在大帐篷里四处乱飞，叽啾鸣唱,他们见了又高兴又惊奇，简直忘乎所以了。 	0
1208	她深深叹息了一声，又寻思那个松木盒子。	1
1209	他们俩双双沉入海里时，灵魂在沼泽地里哭泣着离去了。 	1
1210	“'你对别人想得真是周到，'他老婆答话说，她这时正坐在舒服的扶手椅子里守着熊熊燃烧的松木火取暖；'的确想得十分周到。 	0
1211	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
1212	‘She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,’ cried the young Student; ‘but in all my garden there is no red rose.’	1
1213	Goodbye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.	0
1214	The master of the galley weighed them, and put them into a little bag of green leather. 	0
1215	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
1216	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
1217	在御座的第二个台阶上放着小公主的跪凳，垫子是用银丝布做的,跪凳下面、华盖外边，摆着教皇使节的椅子，专供教皇使节在国王出席各种公共庆典场合下使用,他那顶红衣主教帽子上红缨子盘结在一起，放在前面一个紫色矮凳上。 	0
1218	And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.	0
1219	And suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished steel. 	3
1220	“一位远比我伟大的人为你加冕了啊！”他高声赞叹着，在年轻的国王面前跪了下来。	0
1221	Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.	1
1222	So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.	4
1223	嗨，就是夜莺自己也不怎么好看呀，尽管她深夜在橘林里把歌儿唱得那么动听，有时连月亮都忍不住探下身子听几段；再说啦，他对鸟儿们一直很好：在那可怕的寒冷的冬天，树上全都没有了果实，地上冻得跟铁一样硬，狼群纷纷到城市大门口寻找食物，小矮人从来没有把他们忘记了，总是从他那少得可怜的黑面包里分出些碎渣渣给他们吃，而且只要他有一顿穷兮兮的早餐，也总是分给他们一些。 	4
1224	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.	2
1225	小燕子于是围着芦苇飞啊，飞啊，用翅膀轻轻触动水面，激起一圈圈银色的涟漪。	0
1226	“我承认她是个固守闺房，”燕子继续说，“可我喜爱到处走走，夫唱妇随，我的妻子也应该喜爱到处旅游才是。” 	4
1227	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。 	1
1228	Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.	0
1229	Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?'	3
1230	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
1231	Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'	1
1232	一天夜里，这城市飞来一只小燕子。  	1
1233	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
1234	It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.	0
1235	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。	2
1236	浪花从海浪里接过它，浪沫从浪花里接过它，海岸最终接住了它，捕鱼的小伙子在自己的脚边看见小美人鱼的尸体躺在那里。 	1
1237	早上起来时，他从树上采摘了一些苦涩的浆果充饥，又向大森林出发，哭得伤心极了。	1
1238	Like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing–boats moved in the little bay.	0
1239	“多么不听话的孩子啊！”老河鼠嚷道，“他们只配在水里淹死。”  	2
1240	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	1
1241	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
1242	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
1243	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
1244	The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.	0
1245	So they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their wings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf was so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white rose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him because she loved him.	0
1246	In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palmtrees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.	0
1247	Pale, sickly–looking children were crouched on the huge crossbeams. 	1
1248	But he answered them not a word, but passed on, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the gates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the cathedral, the little page running beside him. 	1
1249	啧，我看跟宫廷大臣的侄儿根本没法儿相比，你的鞋上可有银襻子？”她从椅子上站起身，走进了住宅。 	2
1250	Well, goodbye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.	0
1251	‘'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
1252	鞄靶人看到这股红色尘土时，用绳子把彩绘弓捆起来，跳上他们的小矮马，得得得跑着去迎接那股红色尘土。 	0
1253	“好听啊！好听啊！”	0
1254	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3
1255	Nay,' he answered, 'but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret.'	2
1256	Therefore weep no more but be glad.	0
1257	Some of the boys pranced about on richly–caparisoned hobby–horses brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull, and vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for the bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made of wicker–work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of doing.	0
1258	“快让我看看，瞧瞧这家要什么没什么，我们需要的东西太多了。” 	2
1259	“这对我有什么用？”他对她的古怪行为发问道。 	2
1260	“我敢说他难得有这样的机会换换脑子。 	0
1261	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
1262	“恐怕我惹他生气了，”绿红雀答道， 	1
1263	门道旁神龛中睡觉的人兽神有了它那睡觉的享生兄弟，银质维纳斯站在阳光下朝和她一样可爱的维纳斯伸出手臂。 	4
1264	多么遗憾啊！	1
1265	No one ever saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon–flies. 	0
1266	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。 	1
1267	所以这就是神，我们都对它顶礼膜拜。 	3
1268	在花园最远的角落，一棵树开满了可爰的白花儿。	0
1269	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
1270	咸涩的浪花在桨叶中翻飞。	1
1271	‘What are fireworks like?’ she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.	0
1272	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
1273	Well, really, exclaimed a small Fireballoon, why not? It is a most joyful occasion.	0
1274	Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?	3
1275	她不会钟情于我，我的心会碎的。	1
1276	‘'Oh, don't say that,' cried little Hans, 'I wouldn't be unfriendly for the whole world'; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders.	4
1277	他脚上穿着拖鞋,一只是软蛇皮的,另一只是鸟羽毛做的。 	3
1278	“漂亮的小伙子，漂亮的小伙子哟，”她唠叨说，“这可是要干一件可怕的事情啊。” 	3
1279	他一回来就看见孩子们在花园里玩耍。	0
1280	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。	3
1281	他只是双唇分张，两眼发呆，无所事事地坐在船头,听啊听啊，听得海雾把他悄悄围住，行走的月儿在他那棕色的肢体上撒上一层银色。 	1
1282	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.	3
1283	年轻的国王端详着这些东西，发现它们很美丽。	0
1284	我会在月光下用音乐孕育一朵；用我自己的心血把它染红。 	4
1285	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
1286	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
1287	小矮人的这一串表演彻底打掉了小公主的庄严，小矮人跑出场子很久了她还在笑个不停，还一个劲儿要求她叔叔让小矮人马上再表演一次。 	0
1288	星孩拿上那块黄金，把黄金装进了袋子，急匆匆往城里赶去。 	3
1289	‘I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
1290	巨人看着这幕景致，心融化了。	4
1291	And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.	1
1292	他回答我说：'这就是神。 	4
1293	国王说：“这就是你的母亲，你用泪水清洗了她的脚。”	4
1294	“磨坊主背着一大口袋面粉站在那里。 	3
1295	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
1296	A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust. 	1
1297	“我在寻找我的母亲，”他回答说,“我求求你放我进去，也许她就在这城里呢。”	4
1298	Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
1299	I like hearing myself talk.	0
1300	第二天，一帮干活儿的人来打扫场地。 	0
1301	There were huge tortoise–shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies.	0
1302	“我们真得发表一份告示，禁止鸟类死在这里。” 	2
1303	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
1304	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
1305	‘Ahem! ahem!’ said the Rocket, and he began to cough.	2
1306	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
1307	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
1308	Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the voice?	2
1309	“每个城的国王向我们收税，却不让我们进他们的城门。 	2
1310	On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron–shod boots upon the caked snow.	2
1311	Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?	0
1312	Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.	1
1313	And the people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and said to his Soul, 'Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is not here.'	3
1314	那个年轻人两手把头抱得紧紧的,一点没有听见燕子扑棱翅膀的声音，他抬头看时才发现那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在那些枯萎的紫罗兰上面。	0
1315	第三天晚上他们又来到了一座城市,捕鱼的小伙子对他的灵魂说：“你跟我说过的女子就在这个城里跳舞吗？” 	0
1316	Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.	4
1317	“你在说你自己呢。”焰火筒回答说。 	2
1318	你说得多好啊！'磨坊主的老婆一边说，一边给自己倒了一大杯热乎乎的啤酒，‘我真有点困了，都快睡着了。 	0
1319	The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.	1
1320	‘You are blind now,’ he said, ‘so I will stay with you always.’	4
1321	Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.	0
1322	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜悯之情。	4
1323	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
1324	芦苇一贯喜欢下雨, 可那完全是为了她自己。” 	1
1325	还不如冻死在树林里好呢，要么让什么野兽撞上咱们，吃了也行啊。	3
1326	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
1327	He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords. 	0
1328	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
1329	我当然不能让汉斯坏了本性。 	2
1330	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
1331	My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.’	1
1332	来和我一起玩儿吧，我不会取笑你的。	4
1333	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rosetree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	0
1334	‘If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.’	0
1335	“今天是安息日，他会到那里去的。” 	0
1336	我很高兴我旅行过。	0
1337	但是那麻风病人苦苦哀求，星孩于是对他起了善心，把黄金送给他了。	4
1338	死亡又大笑起来，用手指吹响口哨,一个女人从天而降。	0
1339	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
1340	她们边跳边笑，那笑声像泉水丁冬一样欢快清澈。 	0
1341	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
1342	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
1343	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
1344	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	0
1345	“'这下可算补好了。'小汉斯回答道，从梯子上走了下来。 	0
1346	我讨厌那些夸夸其谈、口口声声离不开自己的人，你就这个德性；人家都还想谈谈自己呢，我就是这样。 	2
1347	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
1348	I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.	0
1349	He had passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion. 	0
1350	她光着的那双脚，像一对小白鸽一样在地毯上挪动着。 	0
1351	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
1352	“来吧！我们去参拜吧。”巫婆小声说,她领着他走过去,而且在她恳求他时,一种强烈的参拜欲望紧紧抓住了他，他于是跟着她走去。 	0
1353	So he sat him down in the market–place and rested, and after a time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.	0
1354	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
1355	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	4
1356	One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. 	0
1357	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
1358	So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.	3
1359	You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.	0
1360	Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fairhaired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great eldertree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.	1
1361	All the wild–dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with the autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with white snow–wreaths in winter, and the blossom–dance through the orchards in spring.	0
1362	我的朋友正在尼罗河上飞来飞去,跟大荷花说话呢。	0
1363	巫婆由于手掌痒起来,便知道他要来了，她哈哈大笑着把她的红头发放了下来。 	0
1364	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任对目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
1365	I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out.	0
1366	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	0
1367	你还是跟我走好,我知道'快活谷'在哪里，知道那里盛产什么。” 	0
1368	“国王的儿子真叫走运，”他说，“他结婚的那天我正好被燃放。	0
1369	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
1370	“我的要求只是小事一件，”捕鱼的小伙子说,“可是刚刚却让神父对我大发脾气，把我赶出来了。 	2
1371	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
1372	她摇了摇头， 	1
1373	皇帝按了一面墙一下，墙就打开了，我们走下一条点燃着许多火炬的过道。 	3
1374	There is a way, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
1375	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
1376	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你愿意和我呆上一个夜晚，给我当当送信人吗？ 	4
1377	于是，他轻手轻脚地抱起那孩子，用斗篷把孩子包裹上，免得孩子受冻，然后寻路下山，向村子走去；他的同伴对他的愚蠢行为和好心肠感到很不理解。	4
1378	然而没有人看见他。	1
1379	He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.	0
1380	“我还能给他送去一颗红宝石吗？ ” 	1
1381	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	0
1382	“你有什么话捎往埃及吗？”他大声说，“我马上要飞走了。” 	2
1383	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
1384	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
1385	Thou art not one of us. 	2
1386	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
1387	因此，快让我们的君主戴上这顶皇冠，拿上这根权杖，以我们国王的公正和慈悲来统治我们吧。”	0
1388	然后他轻轻地绕着床飞,用翅膀往小男孩儿的脑门儿上扇风。	0
1389	国王吹笛子吹得很差劲，可是谁也不敢跟他说明这点，因为他是一国之君呀。 	2
1390	“我毫不怀疑对你来说非常重要，”火箭回答说，“不过要是我愿意，我就会哭。”他还真的泪如泉涌，像雨珠儿一样顺着他的棍子往下流，差一点儿把两只小甲虫淹死,这两只小家伙正在琢磨一起修房盖屋,找一处干爽的地方躲避风雨。	1
1391	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?	2
1392	他的朋友六个星期前都飞往埃及去了，但他耽搁下来，因他和最美丽的芦苇相爱了。	4
1393	And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candle–bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.	0
1394	哎呀呀，瞧瞧我就要把我的手推车送给你了，我以为你会更卖力地干活儿呢。万恶懒为首啊，我当然不喜欢我的任何朋友无所事事，一副懒洋洋的样子。 	2
1395	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me tonight, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
1396	Alas! my son,' she cried, wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
1397	小矮人笑，妖怪也跟着他笑；他把两只手卡在腰间，它也把手卡在腰间。 	0
1398	谁是你的老板？〃年轻的国王问道。 	2
1399	第二天，魔术师来到他跟前，说:“今天你要是不把那块黄金给我带来，那我肯定要把你当奴隶使唤，抽你三百鞭子。”	3
1400	But how shall I send my soul from me?' cried the young Fisherman. 'Tell me how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.'	3
1401	But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby–studded crown, and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls. 	0
1402	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？” 	2
1403	And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night–time he spake her name.	4
1404	他的头发像风信子花一样乌黑，他的嘴唇像他渴求的玫瑰一样殷红,可是激情使他的脸色白如象牙,忧愁使他的额头紧锁。	1
1405	我们只好把它扔掉了。	1
1406	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
1407	Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the colliedog, that would be something.’	2
1408	And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.	1
1409	每天下午，学校放学后孩子们都要来和巨人玩耍。	0
1410	随后，那个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人手持盾牌大声喊叫说：“我的君主怎么能说他不美丽呢？” 	0
1411	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.	2
1412	Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.	2
1413	这根本不是交谈。	2
1414	枯干的刺儿开了花，开出的红玫瑰比红宝石还艳红，	0
1415	“好开心！”他嚷道，我就要这样一直飞上去了。	0
1416	为一个暴君干活儿固然苦，可是干活儿找不到主子更苦啊。	1
1417	然后他们穿过许多条街道，来到一道小门前，开小门的这面墙被一棵石榴树遮掩着。 	0
1418	Nor shall I take aught from thee but that little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.’	3
1419	The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.	4
1420	The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.	0
1421	He swooped past the matchgirl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.	0
1422	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	2
1423	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
1424	我想不会的。 	1
1425	“我笑是因为我高兴呀。”爆竹回答说。	0
1426	“这位做梦能手在哪里？”他们高声叫道，	2
1427	它们向太阳开屏时那尾巴就像象牙碟子，就像镀金碟子。 	0
1428	在高高的城市上空，一根顶天立地的柱子上站立着快乐王子的塑像。	0
1429	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
1430	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
1431	他疲乏地爬下绳梯，消失在海中。	1
1432	他们转了一圈又一圈，年轻的巫婆跳得很高很高，他都能看见她的鞋子的红后跟儿了。 	0
1433	你看，既然我把手推车送给你了，我敢说你准会回报我一些花儿的。 	4
1434	等他来到魔术师的住宅，魔术师给他打开门，让他进来，对他说：“你把那块白金带来了吗？” 	0
1435	Tell me, canst thou see my mother?	1
1436	And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him into the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon his head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by the river he ruled, and was its lord.	0
1437	‘When I was alive and had a human heart,’ answered the statue, ‘I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of SansSouci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.	1

1440	It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.'	1
1441	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.	2
1442	于是他修建了一堵髙墙，把花园围起来，还挂上一块牌子： 	3
1443	人们按他吩咐的去做，把他们埋在那没有香甜的草木生长、冷僻的漂洗工坟地里，人们把土坑挖得很深，把两具尸体埋了进去。 	1
1444	The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal–burners speaking—the Comprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase him. But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage. He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved her. Perhaps she was in the room beyond.	3
1445	In the market–place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and yellow as topazes, citrons and rose–apples and clusters of white grapes, round red–gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.	0

1447	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。” 	0
1448	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
1449	She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.	1
1450	He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.	0
1451	尼罗河没有泛滥，祭士们都在诅咒伊西斯回和奥西里斯図。	1
1452	He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.	1
1453	奴隶们都趴在桨上睡着了。 	1
1454	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	1
1455	I am very glad I have travelled.	0
1456	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
1457	The young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and watched him. 	0
1458	The young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, 'Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold. Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers. And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing that I love?'	1
1459	“天哪！”鹅大声叫道， 	3
1460	And when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to weep, and said, 'I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a King, and my father is aged and alone.' But the young Fisherman answered, 'I will not let thee go save thou makest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to me, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea–folk, and so shall my nets be full.'	1
1461	She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare.	1

1463	野外的鸟儿在树林里飞来飞去，自有它们的自由，	0
1464	他欣喜若狂，一把抓住它，对兔子说："我为你效了点儿劳，你却成倍地补偿了我；我对你发了点儿善，你还我的有百倍之多啊。”	0
1465	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
1466	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
1467	那个老神父也经常找他去，尽心尽力教他热爱有生命的东西，并对他说，蝇子是你的兄弟。	4
1468	What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.	0
1469	They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
1470	What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
1471	The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the ends fast to two iron stanchions. 	3
1472	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
1473	他把他那棕色的髯发从额头往后梳理一下,拿起古琵琶，手指在弦上随意弹动。	0

1476	In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both wine–coloured and coloured like grass.	0
1477	他刚刚做了这两件事，巫婆们就像鹰一样尖叫起来，纷纷逃走，而那张一直注视他的苍白的脸立时因痛苦的抽搐变了形。 	3
1478	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
1479	But the Tree shook its head.	1
1480	Nevertheless let us enter in.'	3
1481	但是孩子们尖声尖气的笑声在他耳边萦绕，明朗而无情的阳光嘲弄着他的悲哀，连早晨清新的空气也混入了一种单调的怪味道，闻起来就像涂抹防腐香料的人使用的那种这是不是一种幻觉？他把脸埋进他的两手， 	1
1482	The riverhorse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.	0
1483	但是，女礼仪官插话说太阳太毒了，认定公主殿下最好赶快回宫，一顿美宴已经为她准备下了，其中有一个真正的生日蛋糕，她名字的略写字母用彩糖涂在了上面，一面可爰的小银旗在上面飘动。 	0
1484	我碰巧和糙纸做的药筒呆在一个抽屉里，今天早上我听到新娘新郎的所有故事,还听说了宫中的最新消息。“ 	0
1485	Do thou give me love.	4
1486	“'我很对不起，'小汉斯说，揉着眼睛把睡帽揭下来，'可是我累得不行，本以为可以在床上多休息一会儿，听听鸟儿唱歌。你知道吗？我听听鸟儿唱，干活儿总是很带劲儿。' 	0
1487	“早死净了。”转轮焰火念叨说，睡了过去。	1
1488	Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.	0
1489	一尊用青铜铸就的那喀索斯国雕像笑容满面，将一面打磨得亮提提的镜子举过头顶。	0
1490	They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.	0
1491	And the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was walking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that had just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been established.	2
1492	没有人看见我们在花丛里来回乱窜，或者在草地上疯了似的追赶蜻蜓。 	0
1493	东方的每件事都充满智慧。 	0
1494	有谁关心过咱们？	1
1495	但是，快乐王子看上去难过极了，小燕子觉得很过意不去。 	1
1496	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
1497	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
1498	那棵树马上鲜花怒放，鸟儿们纷纷飞来在上面唱歌，小男孩儿伸开他的双臂，紧紧抱住了巨人的脖子，亲吻他。	0
1499	And I looked into the mirror, and it was even as he had said to me.	1
1500	In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.	0
1501	Surely thou shouldst have been with me.	1
1502	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
1503	我就总是想到我自己，而且指望别人也都这么做。 	1
1504	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.	1
1505	谁知道小东西会不会给咱家带来坏运气？	3
1506	‘I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,’ remarked the Duck; ‘there are so many things that need reforming.	0
1507	星孩听了这话又一次对他大发慈悲，把那块红色的金子白送了他，说：“你比我更需要它。”	4
1508	‘I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,’ said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; ‘I hope there will be a change in the weather.’	1
1509	It is really too dreadful!	3
1510	请你给我爰吧。	4
1511	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
1512	他的灵魂对他说：“我们别耽搁了，赶快起身吧，因为海神爱妒嫉，有许多俯首听命的怪兽。” 	3
1513	Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my swordhilt?	4
1514	So the Nightingale sang to the Oaktree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	0
1515	我永远都对付不了这种事。	3

1517	“不管哪里，只要你爱它，那儿就是你的世界。”	4
1518	神像是用象牙雕刻的，有人像的两倍大。 	3
1519	That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea–house that is in the Street of Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the palace.	0
1520	It was certainly a magnificent display.	0
1521	They did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that made no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise, which is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.	0
1522	其实只是一只小红雀儿在窗外唱歌，但是因为他很久没有听见鸟儿在他的花园里唱歌，所以他觉得这是人世间最美丽的音乐。	0
1523	快快让我重新进到你身子里，做你的仆人,你就会成为智慧人中的智慧人，智慧就只属于你了。 	0
1524	“我身穿痛苦铸就的衣冠，能高兴起来吗？”年轻的国王说。	1
1525	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
1526	He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his swordhilt.	0
1527	‘Goodbye, dear Prince!’ he murmured, ‘will you let me kiss your hand?’	4
1528	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
1529	过了一会儿，那块红布开始活动，随着笛子越吹越尖厉，两条绿色和金色杂陈的蛇抬起它们那少见的楔形脑袋，慢慢往高伸,随着乐曲摇来摆去，如同一棵草在水中晃动。 	0
1530	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
1531	“我不明白为什么春天这么晚了还不来，”自私的巨人心下思忖，坐在窗前看着他那冰天雪地的花园，“但愿这气候变化变化才好。”	1
1532	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
1533	但是小矮人没有理她们。 	2
1534	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
1535	“不”，死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
1536	那声音十分迷人,，非凡的火箭大家都躺在床上不睡，听我们唱歌。 	0
1537	他们一高兴了就到卖鸟的那里买一只笼鸟养，有时为一时快乐又把鸟放飞了；他们心里难受了就用刺扎他们自己，减轻他们的忧愁。 	1
1538	Phew!' they cried, as they lit upon the ground, 'there is some one here we know not!' and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs. Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind.	3

1540	And the thing shall be done to–night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should see that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.’	2
1541	“这里好冷啊，”他说，“不过我会跟你呆上一个夜晚，给你当送信的人。”	4
1542	黑滚滚的海浪涌向海岸，上面托浮着一样比银子还白的物体。 	3
1543	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她司:星孩问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？” 	2
1544	每天他都在城堡屋顶上劈劈啪啪下三个小时，把屋顶上大多数瓦片都打破了；随后他又在花园转呀转呀，忙不迭地奔啊跑啊。 	0
1545	她从自己的腰带里抽出一把绿蛭蛇皮柄小刀，递给他。 	3
1546	A large press, inlaid with agate and lapis–lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, and a cup of dark–veined onyx. 	0
1547	转眼第二年又过去了，捕鱼的小伙子依然孤零零地呆在那个篱笆房子里，灵魂趁着夜色又对他说：“瞧瞧！我用邪恶引诱过你，我用善良引诱过你，可你的爱情比我强大得多。 	4
1548	Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
1549	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
1550	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
1551	One day the Giant came back. 	3
1552	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
1553	I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day, and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.	0
1554	“今天早上我把那朵花儿亲自送给了小公主，是当生日礼物送的，可他从小公主那里偷走了。” 	2
1555	告诉我如何才能打发走我身上的灵魂，我真的是不需要它了。 	3
1556	‘Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain.	3
1557	巨人欣喜若狂地跑下楼梯，岀了房子冲进花园。	0
1558	“这也没有什么，”鸭妈妈说，“万事开头难啊，做父母的就得有耐心。” 	4
1559	The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.	0
1560	Nay, but be merciful,' said his Soul: 'give me thy heart, for the world is very cruel, and I am afraid.'	3
1561	From the palace of the Sea–King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.	1
1562	海王的宫中又传来哀悼的哭泣；在远处的大海上，大人鱼海神们嘶哑地吹响了他们的号角。 	1
1563	他们过去在树林里就经常看见他，他要么像精灵追逐旋落的叶子那样跳舞，要么蹲在某棵老橡树的洞里和松鼠们分享坚果儿。 	0
1564	It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.	0
1565	The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are empty.	1
1566	他是多么希望同她一起回树林去啊！ 	1
1567	It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water.	3
1568	我称你这种行为是自私，而自私是顶顶讨厌的玩意儿，尤其我这种脾气受不了，因我生来就富有同情心，谁都知道的。	2

1572	Goodbye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
1573	他发沉的眼睑垂了下来，一种少有的消沉一下子支配了他。	1
1574	“他们是我的仆人。”她回答说。 	4
1575	据说那个墓穴里还躺着一个人，死者是一个异常英俊美丽的青年，他的双手用绳子反绑着，胸部被捅了很多刀，衣服都被血染红了。	3
1576	这样，在国王花园的一端搭起了一个大架子，皇家焰火匠将一切安排停当后,焰火们马上交谈起来。 	0
1577	难道你是我们老板派来监视我们的探子吗？	2
1578	再往远处,在一片果园里，一只夜莺在欢唱。	0
1579	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
1580	 'He is a man like myself. 	4
1581	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
1582	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney pots down.	2

1597	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
1598	谢谢你，小燕子，王子说。	4
1599	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
1600	努比亚人像一条遭受践踏的蛇一样乱滚乱跳，嘴唇里扑扑冒着红色血沫。 	3

1623	In the salt–marshes live the lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh them. 	3
1624	小男孩儿对巨人微笑着跟他说：“你曾经让我在你的花园里玩耍过，今天你跟我到我的花园去吧，那是天堂。”	0
1625	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。 	3

1627	Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not wear them. 	2
1628	“我天生就是过公共生活的料，”火箭说，“我的所有亲戚也离不开公共生活，哪怕他们十分渺小。 	1

2119	捕鱼的小伙子笑起来。 	0
2120	I would send my soul away from me,' answered the young Fisherman.	1
2121	快快滚到一边。	2
2122	Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, I am in great trouble.	1
2123	御榻旁的一张桌子上，放着一把锋利的短弯刀。 	3
2124	我们走到过道的中央，皇帝说了一个难以出口的词儿，一道花岗岩门弹回到一个暗簧上，他用手掩住脸，害怕晃了眼睛。 	3

2128	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
2129	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
2130	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说，他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
2131	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant, tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.	2
2132	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
2133	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
2134	‘It is going to rain sticks’; and she rushed into the water.	3
2135	But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little Mermaid and said, 'Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.	4
2136	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
2137	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
2138	They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.	0
2139	那位香客回答说：“看看这面镜子,你会看见他的。“ 	4
2140	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	0
2141	她哗啦哗啦摇着大扇子，拍了几下。 	0
2142	“你没有对我做什么坏事，可是我不需要你了。” 	1
2143	但是，花儿们对他们的举止烦透了,对鸟儿们的举止也烦透了。 	2
2144	“给我一粒吧，”死亡说，“我把它种在花园里；只要一颗，我马上就走。” 	3
2145	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	2

2148	他的灵魂苦苦地恳求他，可是他不为所动，只是从一块岩石向另一块岩石跳去,脚步稳得像一只野山羊，最后他下到了地面，眼前就是黄色的海岸。 	1
2149	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
2150	‘A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,’ answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
2151	And the young Fisherman said to himself: 'How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.'

2159	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
2160	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
2161	吉卜赛人确实表演得非常成功。 	0
2162	我回答说我是伊斯兰教托钵僧，赶往麦加城去朝圣，那里有一条绿纱巾，天使们用双手把《古兰经》全都绣在上面了，每个字都银光闪闪的。 	0
2163	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
2164	小松鼠在杉树上过着孤单的生活，他对小松鼠说：“我的母亲在哪里呢？”	1
2165	河马冲着我们发怒，千方百计袭击我们。 	3
2166	“那僧侣向我求救，说：'大人您快把奴仆的眼睛治好吧，我会把神指给你看的。' 	4

2168	I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.	0
2169	But the young Fisherman laughed.	0
2170	“‘你这孩子真是蠢材！'磨坊主大叫道，'我真不明白送你上学有什么用处。你看样子什么都没有学会。 	2

2175	一抹淡淡的茉莉花香从敞开的窗子飘了进来。	0
2176	‘Dear me!’ said the little Squib, ‘I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour.’	2
